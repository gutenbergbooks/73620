<p class="right noindent small">
Lat. 25° 4′ S.; long. 130° 8′ W.: August 18.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent p1">Rest, peace, the sounds of a summer noon,
and the murmur of waves. The calm of a
peak in the Pacific thirteen thousand miles
away from the dome of St. Paul’s, and completely
out of sight of it, if only by reason of
the curvature.</p>

<p>I hardly know how I came here. When
last I took stock of myself, I was standing on
the steps of the Royal Exchange, on another
summer afternoon, and looking down. I was
busy as usual. I am playing with my little
pocket agenda now (perhaps the last I shall
ever buy) as I lie here on the broad of my
back, and I turn to the entry for that day:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">(2)</span>
‘8, Gallop, Row; 9.30, letters, coffee; 10.30,
article for “Quarterly”; 12.30, City (I wanted
Staples to put something on Turks, and thought
I had better be on the spot); 1.30, lunch;
2.30 to bedtime, horse sale, chrysanthemums,
calls, club, early dinner, address Working
Men’s Constitutional Association—“Social
Harmonies,” dance at Mrs. G.’s, club again,
Daudet, bed.’</p>

<p>A mosaic like this is all very well, but a
trifle throws it out. When I had done with
Staples, I had no further business at the Royal
Exchange. I had certainly nothing to do on
the steps; yet I lingered there. It was only
for ten minutes, but it spoiled my day, and
perhaps changed my destiny.</p>

<p>It was such a sight—civilisation in a
nutshell—that was what made me pause.
I was a part of it, and Apollo was taking a
peep at his own legs. Why not? we all
seemed to be going on so beautifully; we were
all busy, all doing something for progress.
What a scene! The Exchange I had just
left, with its groups of millionaires gossiping
Bagdad and the Irawaddy, Chicago and the
Cape; dividend day over at the Bank yonder,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">(3)</span>
and the well known sight of the Blessed going
to take their quarterly reward; a sheriff’s
coach turning the angle of the Mansion House
(breakfast to an African pro-consul, I believe),
a vanishing splendour of satin and plush and
gold; dandy clerks making for Birch’s, with
the sure and certain hope of a partnership in
their easy grace; shabby clerks making for
the bun shops; spry brokers going to take the
odds against Egyptians, and with an appropriate
horsiness of air; a parson (two hundred
and fortieth annual thanksgiving sermon at
St. Hilda’s to commemorate Testator’s encounter
with Barbary pirates, and providential
escape); itinerant salesmen of studs, pocket
combs, and universal watch keys; flower girls
at the foot of the statue, a patch of colour;
beggar at the foot of the steps, another patch,
the red shirt beautifully toned down in wear—Perfect!
We want more of this in London—giant
policeman moving him on; irruption
of noisy crowd from the Cornhill corner
(East-End marching West to demonstrate for
the right to a day’s toil for a day’s crust);
thieves, and bludgeon men, and stone men in
attendance on demonstration; detectives in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">(4)</span>
attendance on thieves; shutters up at the
jewellers’ as they pass; probable average of
7<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> to the hundred pockets; with a wall
only to divide them from all the turtle of the
Mansion House, or all the bullion of the Bank!
And, for background, the nondescript thousands
in black and brown and russet and
every neutral hue, with the sun over all, and
between the sun and the thousands the London
mist.</p>

<p>It was something as a picture, but so
much more as a thought. What a wonder
of parts and whole! What a bit of machinery!
The beggars, and occasionally the
stock jobbers and the nondescripts to go
wrong; the policeman to take them up; the
parson to show the way of repentance; and
the sheriff to hang them, if need be, when all
was done. With this, the dandies to adorn
the scene—myself not altogether unornamental—the
merchants, the clerks, and the dividend
takers, all but cog and fly and crank
of the same general scheme. What a bit of
machinery!</p>

<p>But suddenly the sunlight faded, and
there was a change in me. It was not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">(5)</span>
change of cause and effect, but only a coincidence.
I fancied I saw the man in red furtively
writhing in his shirt with the beggar’s
itch, scratching himself, so to speak, against
his own clothes. At any rate, something
threw the apparatus out of gear. They
seemed all scratching themselves on the sly.
The whole thing looked as well as ever; but
how did it work? I saw the clerks home,
the shabbies to Stockton lodgings of unstained
brick, where infants down with the measles
called for drink in the night, and querulous
wives compounded that claim for romance
with which every woman born of woman
comes into the world for the not too solid
certainty of bread and butter, at thirty shillings
a week all told. I saw the brokers
making for their haven of Bayswater stucco
to receive the reports of Jane’s progress in
Elementary Physics, Master Harry’s broken
window, the afternoon call of the Bristow
family to bring news that of late Mr. Bristow
has not been feeling quite so well—receiving
these things, I say, and wanting to stamp and
shout, or do something to give a pulse to life.
I saw the sheriff’s coach, methought, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">(6)</span>
Care in it. There had been another troublesome
meeting in Hyde Park; London was
going to be governed for Londoners; and <span class="cor" title="Source: to night’s" id="cor6">to-night’s</span>
snug Company Dinner, with its guzzling
treasurers, masters, wardens, upper wardens,
renter-wardens, past masters, chaplains, and
the whole batch might be one of the last of the
disgusting series. The very policeman had his
anxieties; would civic reform bring him down
to the wage level of the Metropolitan force?
A soldier who had strayed into the prospect
seemed to think it was odd to have to guard
the Bank on sevenpence a day. They were all
scratching themselves; and when an entire
civilisation begins to do that, it is a serious
thing.</p>

<p>It was a serious thing for me. For the
life of me I could not get them into focus
again for my grand pictorial composition of a
community all playing the game of life for
mutual diversion. Theirs was rather that
infernal game of bowls in the Fourth Circle,
where the tormented wretches will roll the
balls in one another’s faces, when a more
sensible direction would give them delightful
sport. I drove home, telegraphed an excuse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">(7)</span>
to the Constitutional Association, and, I am
ashamed to say, went to bed.</p>

<p>I was no better next morning. Human
society was still out of focus. I describe the
complaint with some minuteness, because I
believe it is quite a new case for the books,
and I may go down to posterity, with my
name tacked to this disease, like a second
Bright. The anguish is insufferable: it is a
sort of intense vertigo, with a very disagreeable
accompaniment of sickness in the region
of the heart, that robs life of all joy. The
men and women about you, instead of having
any relation to one another of love, friendship,
trust, sympathy, and use, become a mass
of gyrating atoms, with nothing but repulsions
for their principle of movement. At times
you do not know your own brother for such.
They form no whole; they will not compose;
say, rather, they are out of focus, I come back
to that. How to get them in?</p>

<p>I consulted a friend of a most practical
order of mind, and, while frankly confessing
his ignorance of the complaint, he thought,
from my persistent mention of the word focus,
that distance might be the remedy. ‘You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">(8)</span>
were too near,’ he said, ‘get further off. Go
down to Richmond, and dine.’ I thought
there might be something in that, and I
took his advice. Still it would not come
right. So I started for Paris by the night
mail.</p>

</div>


<p class="noindent">London was now quite out of the question:
Paris compelled me to be so busy with itself.
I had not seen it for years, and had never
gone below the surface. The tomb of Napoleon,
and the view from the Arch (see Guide)
were about the measure of my experience.
This time I found a guide of another kind,
and he gave me a glimpse of the real show.</p>

<p>He put me down at the Flute, a delightful
club, where they try to amuse themselves all
the year round. When they are not fiddling,
at select evening concerts, they are showing
their pictures; and when they are not showing
their pictures, they are holding an assault-at-arms—the
Flute is a great school of fence—or
reviewing the year in a fancy piece, written,
mounted, and played by their own men, in
their own theatre. My Mentor gave me a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">(10)</span>
month—as he facetiously put it—at another
club, the choicest thing there. Through an
acquaintance at the Jockey, I found a box-seat
on a coach for the private race meeting at
La Marche—very pretty, very select; no
coming in your thousands, as at the Grand
Prix, but just a snug thing between you and
me, and a few others, of entirely the right
sort. The women looked sweet and fresh as
a bed of primroses; the course was like a
tennis lawn; we lunched <i lang="it">al fresco</i>, and no one
threw bones on the grass. Far, far away the
yell of the bookmaker, and the smell of town.
I never enjoyed anything more.</p>

<p>I was presented all round, and was engaged
for a reception that night, at the house
of one of the chaperones.</p>

<p>‘You will see the best salon in Paris,’
said A.</p>

<p>‘And what is a salon?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I don’t know; they say nobody
knows but themselves. Perhaps a crowd of
clever people trying to kill the worm of ennui.
Nothing like that at home, where the beast is
as sacred as the cow at Benares.’</p>

<p>It was <i lang="fr">grand monde</i> tinctured with literature—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">(11)</span>
was the social blend. We went
to a delightfully old-fashioned house, one of
the few left, and saluted a delightfully old-fashioned
person—a Marquise, I believe, to
complete the harmony of association—who
looked like an original of some Moreau le
Jeune. Her hair was silver—perfect Louis
XV., without the powder puff; she had quick
piercing eyes, black amid all this whiteness,
and there was a suspicion of hoop in her skirts.
She was the queen of a little court, and very
condescending. The courtiers acted up to
their part by elegant flatteries. They told
little stories <em>at</em> her to exemplify her wit and
spirit, and capped quotations from her last
book, in stage asides. The book was just out,
and we had learned it by heart that morning,
as the inevitable topic of the small hours. It
was a dainty <i lang="fr">article de Paris</i>; all her ripe
experiences of life distilled in maxim, after the
manner of M. de la Rochefoucauld. Every
other maxim was about love; they are sometimes
too young, but never too old for that
vital theme. There was a certain disinterested
grandeur in the attitude of the
Marquise. ‘I too have played the grand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">(12)</span>
game,’ she seemed to say, ‘and now I umpire
the match.’</p>

<p>‘“One of the consolations of old age for a
woman,” said a quoting courtier to his neighbours,
“is to dare follow her inclinations without
peril of love, and show herself a devoted
friend, without encouraging dangerous hopes.”
Is it possible to speak with more <i lang="fr">finesse</i>?’</p>

<p>‘I overheard you,’ said the Marquise
gaily, ‘but you weaken the compliment by
talking so loud. I am not old enough to be
deaf.’</p>

<p>‘For my part,’ said the other, ‘I want to
know how the Marquise found you all out so
well, <i lang="fr">vous autres</i>. Listen to this: “Habit has
as much power over the nature of men as the
unknown over the mind of women.” That is
my pearl from the chaplet. It is so true.’</p>

<p>‘And so finely said!’</p>

<p>‘Ah, all you care about is the workmanship,’
said our hostess. ‘But I tell you, I have
lived all that.’</p>

<p>A General came by, with a charming
woman on his arm. He was, in some sort, a
counterpart of the elderly muse—silvery hair,
a raven brow, and sparkling eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">(13)</span></p>

<p>‘The butcher of the Commune,’ whispered
A. to me. ‘His column made the fewest
prisoners.’</p>

<p>‘They are beginning to be troublesome
again, General,’ I heard the lady say. ‘That
dreadful meeting yesterday! Did you see the
account?’</p>

<p>‘We are ready for them, Madame;
and with the old argument, mitraille; I
assure you they only pretend to like it: it
hurts.’</p>

<p>There was a story about everybody—not
always a good one; but their worst stories
were told in their best way. With us, there is
so much ingenuity of subterfuge in the other
direction. We might do as well, if we dared.
They dare, because the women insist on it, and
the sovereign obligation is to keep the women
amused—the best women, and best is brightest
here. It is a great assault of arms for the
gallery, and, if you have a good place, it is
pleasanter to be in the gallery than in the
ring. The exertion is terrible; some of the
most noted performers, I believe, lie abed all
next day. You have to justify by gifts, as well
as by graces; and the gifts are not always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">(14)</span>
there. Beautiful statues are left on their
pedestals: the word tells.</p>

<p>Still, I don’t think they make the best of
their women. There is, perhaps, a finer use.
They try to make the most of them, certainly.
The women shape the whole civilisation, and
they are just now labouring with much energy
at the decline and fall. I have always wondered
why they do not include a representation
of this commanding interest in the
government—<i lang="fr">Le Ministère de la Femme</i>. It
would soon rule the whole cabinet, for the
incumbent would be sure to know the business
of most of the other departments—War,
Commerce, Interior, Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>It is too good for every day—life on the top
of a twelfth cake, and some of the figures no
more to be visited by sun and rain and the
winds of Heaven than if they were cast in
sugar. I heard one of them taking the law
from another, on the authority of a gazette of
fashion, as to the right way of getting up on
a winter’s morning. There are two ways, it
seems. ‘An hour before you turn out, <i lang="fr">ma
chère</i>, the maid is to light your fire, and put
up the screen. Silver lined with pink silk is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">(15)</span>
pretty; it throws a sort of rosy morning light
into the room. Mind you have your chocolate
on a warmer! And do you know how to
warm your toast-rack? A little live charcoal
sprinkled with vanilla; it makes the air so
sweet. Raoul gave me such a love of a toast-rack
(<i lang="fr">un amour</i>) the other day. They are
making them in gold now. Don’t jump up
at once, mind—snooze. What do you wear for
a <i lang="fr">déshabillé</i>? I like satin lined with swansdown,
and velvet fastenings; buttons are so
horribly cold. Line your slippers with swansdown,
too; I hate a cold slipper. B-r-r-r!
Madame d’Argenson warms her bath-room
with little gusts of rose vapour, pumped
through a hole in the wall; it is an idea. Do
you know how to get warm? Never get cold.
Floss silk for your stockings, if you please. I
won’t even <em>see</em> cold. I have my blinds embroidered
with a rising sun, and the maid
brings in fresh flowers with the chocolate. It
makes summer in the room. <i lang="fr">Excusez du peu.</i>
Then, if you want to know how happy you
are, just lift the blind, and peep out, and see
the people dancing on the pavement to keep
themselves warm. But you’ll see enough of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">(16)</span>
that when you drive, if you like to look at
such things. I don’t. They are making little
things in enamel, for muff warmers, now;
tiny apples filled with hot water—not big
ones, or you’ll spoil the shape of your hands.
Besides, big ones would make your fingers
red; you only want to make them rosy, <i lang="fr">pas
trop n’en faut</i>.</p>

<p>‘What kind of gloves do you sleep in? I
prefer a plush lining to the kid. Some say
swansdown. I think it’s <em>too</em> warm. Remember
there is the coverlet. Stick to plush, you
can’t do better, from head to foot. I have
seen the nightcap fastened with a little cosy
turtle-dove, just under the left ear—if you lie
on that side. And make her bring you a
light <i lang="fr">crême de Sabaillon</i> when you turn in.
You know, two fresh eggs, and a small glass
of Madeira. B-r-r-r! how I hate the cold.’</p>

<p>A padded person of the sterner sex, who
was one of the council, propounded a still
more original scheme. ‘<i lang="fr">Chère Comtesse</i>, why
all these precautions, when you might so easily
get out of the way? I travel in search of
perpetual summer, and find it. My man
begins to move south, as soon as the cold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">(17)</span>
threatens here, and the moment he finds
settled sunshine, he telegraphs me to come on.
I never go till Nature is ready, and, when I
reach one place, he starts for another, so I
always have sunshine in reserve. We keep
steadily flying south till the turn of the
weather, and then we make north again for
the Paris May. I was only caught twice by
rain last year, and once by sleet, and then I
threatened to discharge him if it happened
again. <i lang="fr">Chère Comtesse</i>, life is too precious:
do not waste it in these trials. Will you
have a cup of tea?’</p>

<p>‘He is very wretched, for all his make-believe,’
said Mentor, ‘he is going to marry;
and he is in a torment of prospective jealousy.
It is the funniest case in the world. The
young person is faultless; all our young
persons are, you know. He pays the proper
visits, always in evening-dress—it is our way—and
talks to her about the picture-gallery
of the Louvre, and the Advent sermons, for
just three-quarters of an hour by the clock,
with her mother on guard all the time. This
is courtship. When she marries, she will acquire
the privilege of watching others in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">(18)</span>
same way, and of being herself unwatched;
and there the retribution comes in. He is
not in the least jealous now; he only knows
he is going to be. There are complications,
you see. He is not only about to marry the
young person, he is very fond of her, which
is perhaps inexcusable at his time of life. In
the days of his age he remembers his youth,
and—<i lang="fr">il n’a pas confiance</i>. He is meditating
some domestic ukase about visitors, and positively
wants to include his mother-in-law in
the family circle. “The duenna, or the cheap
defence of households,” is, I believe, the idea.
All this, of course, implies no suspicion of the
lady, but only a most horrible retrospective
suspicion of himself. “Do to others as you
would not be done by,” has been the rule of
his joyous life; and—<i lang="fr">il n’a pas confiance</i>. We
used to call him “Proverbs.” His choicest
conversational effect was a detestable little
saying about the folly of acquiring the material
of happiness for yourself, when you
might always command the stores of your
friends. He never quotes his proverb now.
I would rewrite the story of Don Juan from
his case, with this torment for the Nemesis.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">(19)</span>
Let Juan marry and settle on this prospect of
eternal anguish, and leave old raw-head the
Commandant, and his horse, for the nursery
tales.’</p>

<p>To a lazy man like myself there is but one
drawback in this city; you are rather expected
to make love to your neighbour’s wife. The
nuisance is even greater than in London. They
are not exactly rude to you, if you don’t,
but they mark their sense of your behaviour
in a thousand delicate ways. It is considered
disrespectful to the lady of the house.</p>

<p>We went to the Opera, and, of course, he
led me behind the scenes. It is certainly magnificent.
The most self-indulgent monarchs
have never enjoyed half so much luxury as
these essentially combining people get on the
joint-stock principle. They are true democrats,
and, as their institutions develop, the
poorest will have his <i lang="fr">parc aux cerfs</i>. There
is no selfishness in the <i lang="fr">foyer de la danse</i>; all
the subscribers are brothers, all equal, all
free, as in a temple of faith. <i lang="fr">Ces dames</i>
make no distinctions of persons. It was
touching to see Army, Navy, Commerce,
Senate, and Bar—Bench, I believe, as well—paying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">(20)</span>
homage at these gauze-curtained
shrines. Radical and Conservative leaders,
wealthy Jews, the epigrammatic General I
had just met, sparks from the club, and some
hideous heads of age that ought to have been
under nightcaps, were all at their devotions,
visiting one shrine after another, sometimes
with offerings. <i lang="fr">Mesdames</i> were occasionally
wayward and severe, but I am loath to believe
that they are cruel divinities, and I am
confirmed in this by those who know them
best. It was a brilliant scene, the green room
itself a blaze of decoration, in ceiling, chandeliers
and walls; portraits of great dancers and
composers on the panels; grand pictorial
compositions above, the War dance, the
Country dance, the Love dance, the Bacchic
dance; below, a curious patchwork of black
coat and white skirt, with here and there a
sylph pirouetting for practice, on a floor that
slopes like the stage—a fleece cloud driven by
the wind—or holding on for support to an
iron bar cased with velvet, and pointing, with
satin-shod toe, to another and a brighter
world. Here, as I have said, Valour reposes
after the toils of war, and Legislation after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">(21)</span>
fatigues of debate. Art sketching in the
corner is represented by that solitary, who has
a passion for problems, and who is haunted by
the desire to transfer this poetry of motion to
canvas, and to make the work tremble with life
as you gaze. Great soul and genius, the only
single-minded one in all this throng—hail!</p>

<p>We looked in at another club on the way
home, a mere <i lang="fr">tripot</i> this, but gorgeous like all
the rest, and throwing blazing beams across
the boulevard from its many chandeliers.
Here their industry is <i lang="fr">baccarat</i>, and the net
profits of many a mine and factory, transmitted
by inheritance to youths of spirit who
want to see the world, pass from hand to
hand across the baize. Sailors reef the topsail
in storms, coal miners lie on backs or
bellies in the dark, girls ripen to premature
womanhood in the tropic heat of factories, to
feed this sport. I lost a few coins, supped,
and came away. One of the players was
pointed out to me as the inventor of a new
diversion, the Snail Race. The race-course is
a smooth board, with a lighted candle at the
end, laid on the table in a darkened room.
The snails naturally creep towards the light.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">(22)</span>
There are miniature hurdles, and a water-jump,
and the handicapping is done with
pellets of clay. You may lose quite enough
at this to make it exciting, by maintaining a
due disproportion between the amount of the
wager and the value of the snail. It is played
between five and six, just before dressing for
dinner, and it fills in an hour that many find
heavy on their hands.</p>

<p>Next day it was a drive in the Bois to
salute one’s friends. I had already quite a
list of them. Surely this people have the
secret, I thought, as we span along through
alleys of tender green, with sunlight dancing
in the leaves, blue and white in the bordering
villas, and the purple slopes of Valérien
to close in the scene. We skipped the Lake,
according to directions, and looked out for
faces under the acacia trees. They were all
there. I was so delighted with it that I
could not go indoors; so we pushed on, by the
Cours la Reine, and the river, to see more.</p>

<p>They have the philosophic taste for
angling; the banks were lined, yet the waters
lost nothing by their sport. It was live and
let live, with man and fish. We had left the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">(23)</span>
black coats behind us; they were blouses
now; and everywhere the white and blue and
green, the brightness, and the leisured groups.
A worthy pair of retired <i lang="fr">rentiers</i>, male and
female, seemed to have devoted the whole
afternoon to washing their poodle in the
Seine. Monsieur lathered him, and drove him
into the water for the rinsing with innocent
oaths and ejaculations, ‘<i lang="fr">cré nom!</i> <i lang="fr">bigre!</i> <i lang="fr">saperlipopette!</i>’
or whistled him back with a
properly certificated dog-call, when he seemed
to be going out of his depth. Madame stood
by with towel, comb, and brush. For this they
had kept the little grocer’s shop at the corner
of the Rue St. Jacques de la Boucherie for
seven-and-twenty years, and toiled late and
early, Sabbath and fête, and put savings in
the Paris Loans! ‘And why not?’ I ask,
with ever increasing emphasis, while anyone
shall say, ‘And why?’ All classes seem so
happy, I thought, so innocently gay—it is
the stock reflection of the tourist in the
Paris streets.</p>

<p>I was standing on the bridge; and just
then there was a rush past me of the <i lang="fr">avant-garde</i>
of a crowd, followed by the main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">(24)</span>
body. They were fierce-looking and sorrowful.
Those who were not in blouses wore grease-polished
coats and hats—always a bad sign—and
the few who were not frowning had
the grease in their smile, always a worse.
There was a woman at the head of them, in
black, and carrying a black flag, an angular
creature, as lantern-jawed as a saint from a
missal, with eyes like live coals.</p>

<p>‘What is it? Who is it?’</p>

<p>‘The Red Virgin. We want bread,
<i lang="fr">citoyen</i>.’</p>

<p>It was not literally true, I think—most of
them looked fat enough—prospectively true,
perhaps. They hurried off towards the outer
boulevards, I following, and, on their way,
they pillaged a baker’s shop, the Black or Red
one standing by, and waving her corpse-flag
with approval, but touching no morsel of the
food. Then they poured into a dirty little
hall, garnished in the vestibule with a collection
of pamphlets inciting to murder and
arson, and began to ‘meet.’</p>

<p>They had a clear issue before them, and
they knew their own minds. They were met
to see how they could burn down civilisation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">(25)</span>
Nothing more, nothing less. Government was
to go, property, laws, classes, the whole framework,
with all the pretty things I had lately
seen—the drag that took me to La Marche,
the salons, the Opera, the coaches in the
Wood, myself too, I suppose, by implication,
though none took notice of me. They spoke
with beautiful volubility, precision, logic, each
man perfect in the spouter’s gift.</p>

<p>Presently the Virgin in black rose, and I
began to understand why she was called the
Red. She spoke in sing-song the chaunted
dirge of the thing they wanted to burn.
It was very grotesque, and very serious.
‘Citizens, it must all go, only the fire can
purge it. Nothing will better it; it has been
bettering for eighteen centuries, and it is
worse to-day. I believed once, like them, and
wrote hymns to the other Virgin, and I know
she never hears. She is made of stone, like
their hearts. O citizens, the infamy of it!—their
fine houses and fine feasts, fine adulteries
and fine lies, with labour for their everlasting
bond-slave and thrall. <i lang="fr">Voyons!</i> it is all a
mockery. How many of you, before we broke
the bread shop open, had eaten to-day?’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">(26)</span>
‘<i lang="fr">Moi!</i>’ shouted perhaps twenty voices, and
about as many hands were held up, while
about five times as many were held down.
‘If there were only one,’ said the Red Virgin,
‘we would burn it for that one. What! with
ships in every port, and the finest climate and
soil in the universe, and all the labour and all
the martyrdom of the past behind us to start
us fair, we cannot give every man his crust
and his cup of wine! <i lang="fr">Voyons: on se moque de
nous!</i> Stand out of the way, with your
governments and your religions, and leave us
to ourselves, to be good. We should be so
good without you. It would be so easy; love
comes naturally to man, and justice; only the
<em>laws</em> of loving and the <em>laws</em> of justice bar the
way. The codes are between us and the
Sun. Burn them, and start afresh. <i lang="fr">Vive
l’Anarchie!</i>’</p>

<p>‘<i lang="fr">Vive l’Anarchie!</i>’ cried most of us, but it
was not <abbr>nem. con.</abbr> ‘Down with the Virgin,’
shouted a big, black-muzzled fellow near the
door; and he meant the Red one too!</p>

<p>‘<i lang="fr">A la porte l’espion!</i>’ roared fifty others
back at him. It was a fight.</p>

<p>He was not alone—‘<i lang="fr">à bas la Vierge!</i>’ repeated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">(27)</span>
his body-guard, closing round him.
The chairs were broken into fragments in an
instant, and I was luckily able to interpose
my walking-stick between one of the fragments
and the head of a prostrate man.</p>

<p>So they fell to buffets, the troubled souls
who had met to settle the new law of love,
beating each other cruelly with hand and
foot. It was clear possession, and their tormentors
were, perhaps, the self-same legion
that once did duty in the swine. They tore
each other, in sheer impatience for the rise of
the curtain on the great poetic drama of the
Millennial Reign. They had bad seats for the
show, I think; that had something to do with
it; in the comparative airiness of the boxes,
patience does not come so hard.</p>

<p>I strolled away. Out of focus, too, this
group of humanity; and worse than the
last!</p>

</div>


<p class="noindent">I was really running away now. It was not
retreat, but flight; useless to pretend that I
was even looking civilisation in the face.</p>

<p>Some instinct led me to Geneva. There
would be safety, I thought, in its balanced
poetry and prose, the mountains held in check
by the tourists, the lake by the hotels.</p>

<p>But I had reckoned without the gentleman
whose crown I had saved in the late
<i lang="fr">mêlée</i>. He turned up one day on Rousseau’s
Island, and hailed me as a brother. I assured
him I was but a second cousin, at the outside.
It was in vain. He led me to a remote garret
in the old town, and introduced me to a circle
of blood relations in democracy, by whom,
after examination, I was received into the
family.</p>

<p>I did not mind; only it was hard to find
this sort of thing going on everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">(29)</span></p>

<p>I was evidently found to improve on acquaintance,
for, one day, I was solemnly invited
to a polyglot tea party, in another garret,
with a Russian lady making the tea.</p>

<p>It was green tea, fortunately; else it would
have been altogether too absurdly innocent a
compound for this entertainment. Everybody
but myself had done something, and I felt
quite ashamed to say that I had only stood
on the steps of the Royal Exchange. My
sponsor came out in a new light; he had been
first smearer of petroleum at the Ministry of
Finance, during the Commune. He assured
us that no other building burnt half so well.
He laid it all on the <i lang="fr">rez-de-chaussée</i>; his colleagues
wasted their stuff on the upper walls.
A friend from Spain had shot three priests in
the Carthagena riots, with one discharge of a
blunderbuss. There was an offer to introduce
me as one of the gentlemen who tried to sky
London Bridge, so that I might not look
strange, but I hate a false pretence. The
lady at the samovar was a student emissary,
who crossed the frontier with despatches, and
she had just come back with news. She had
seen the latest execution at St. Petersburg—two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">(30)</span>
of the brethren and one sister hanging
up in the falling snow, as stiff as frozen ox-tongues.
There were other cheerful reports
from Rome, and from Belgrade; and one companion,
who was strong in geography, gave
us a bird’s-eye of the whole woeful earth. It
was to much the same effect, only that, further
afield, the dull pain of living was oftener met
by endurance than by revolt. We had five
minutes in the native quarter at Amoy, and
saw an ingenious device of the needy to qualify
as mendicant cripples, by making their feet
rot off. It is something of a trade secret; but
the right way is to tie a cord tightly round
the ankle, till the member mortifies. It is
a living—where it is not certain death. Next,
we were with the stark naked casuals, squatting
in the streets of Pekin in winter time,
while, gorged with humanitarian learning, the
lordly scholars pass. We came home by way
of Central Asia, and dropped in on the squalid
poor of Smarkand lousing among their quilted
rags. The coaling coolies at Aden detained
us but a moment; and, but a moment more,
the sponge divers of the Ægean, with their
lungs choked with blood, for the great law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">(31)</span>
of the margin of subsistence reaches even to
the ocean bed.</p>

<p>Next day, I made straight for Genoa. I
seemed to labour for breath on the dry land,
and to want the sweet clean sea.</p>

<p>There was an Italian merchantman in port,
fitting out for a voyage round the world. They
had macaroni on board; and, if they had boiled
the huge cargo, they might have girdled the
globe as they sailed. They were going to
take it to Ceylon and the Philippines, by way
of the Suez Canal, and then, come back by the
Horn to pick up something for the home market.
I wanted a ship; they were not averse
to a passenger. Short of ballooning, it seemed
the readiest way of giving Civilisation the slip.</p>

<p>We sailed; and, as I just had the honour
to inform you, here I am, on a peak in the
Pacific, and thirteen thousand miles away from
the dome of St. Paul’s—which, as everybody
knows, is but a stone’s throw from the Royal
Exchange. For distance, I think this will do.</p>

<span class="title">ADVENTURE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">How I got there, this chapter will tell.</p>

<p>The calm of that passage of the Indian
Ocean!—the days of sunlight, a little too
ardent, perhaps; the nights of moons—the
calm of the spirit, I mean, profounder than
the calm of waters. A ship is either a
heaven or a hell; and when it is a heaven,
why not let that one suffice? The world
empty, and no papers—no daily report from
the sick bed of civilisation. Who could want
more, or less?</p>

<p>Ceylon, with its new faces and its shipman’s
bustle, hardly ruffled our repose, and when it
did, I shut my eyes. At the Philippines, it
was much the same. Both are fully described
in the Gazetteers.</p>

<p>Then it was hey! for the next long lap to
the Horn, with only a call for water or for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">(33)</span>
wild-fowl, here and there. We were in the
Pacific now, for all its bursts of temper how
finely named! Should not all oceans, boreal
or equinoctial, have the same generic title,
for, spite of storm and reef and waterspout,
surely their message is peace? Such stretches
of proud, self-sufficing silence in between the
gusts, such comforting assurance, in deepest
whispers, of the final rest! Here, on salt water
only, can we set compass for the land voyage.
Now and again it thundered, and the rain
crashed down like falling walls of water, but
always my soul was still. If the worst
happened, we should still reach the deepest
bottom at last, and find a soft bed in the ooze.</p>

<p>There was magnetic disturbance of a kind,
however, in that Italian skipper. He was not
too well acquainted with the course, and he
was subject to scares about cannibals. He
feared that the natives of these parts might
prefer him to his macaroni. He had an old
Genoese edition of Cook, and he read it as if
it were a deliverance of yesterday. Whenever
we touched at an island, existence seemed
hardly worth having at his price of precaution—scouts,
and rear-guard, and main body, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">(34)</span>
to effect a positive life insurance against some
old woman squatting on a mat. Poisoned
arrows, again, were his peculiar aversion,
and, to keep out of reach of them, he usually
directed landing operations through a trumpet
from the ship’s side. In vain I argued
that one fear ought to preclude the other,
and that, if they poisoned him, he would
certainly never be fit to eat. Sometimes I
tried to reassure him by landing alone, and
returning with an escort of friendly natives,
and a store of yams. The lesson was lost on
him; he attributed my safety to the fact
that my joints offered no temptation to the
critical eye.</p>

<p>One glorious afternoon, sailing from the
south we saw a peak rising sheer from the
ocean and huge, for it still might be about
thirty miles off. It seemed to taper from a
broad and solid base, like the summit of a
cathedral. He said, ‘St. Peter’s.’ I said,
‘St. Paul’s.’ As we got nearer, we made out
a small island of solid rock, with sharp precipitous
sides, plumped down in the blue, and
with no neighbours in sight. Add Kensington
Gardens to Hyde Park, and you might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">(35)</span>
its total area. It was covered with verdure
and stately trees; but a fringe of white at the
water’s edge showed that, in spite of the
perfectly calm weather, the surf was boiling
against its awful shores.</p>

<p>It looked fruity, though desolate, and I
insisted on going ashore for guavas, much to
the disgust of the skipper. He offered me
dried plums, in dissuasion, from a box fringed
with paper lace, but the sight of them only
increased my craving for the fresh fruit. At
last he let me put off alone, crossing himself
as I left the ship’s side; but he had done
this so often that it made no particular impression
on me. I promised to be back in
three hours at the outside, while he stood off
and on. There was no anchorage for us, even
if there had been time to let go.</p>

<p>The little place grew in beauty as I neared
it, but in grimness, too. Below the verdure,
it was all great fangs of rock, biting into the
sea at the sharpest angles. The surf was
more terrible than ever on a closer view.
The water was flaked with the fury of its strife
with the iron-bound shore. I thought of
turning back, but I am very fond of guavas.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">(36)</span>
Besides, I had seen something of the management
of boats in surf, and I fancied it was
easier than it looked. The knack is to mount
the crest of a wave, and shoot in with it into a
soft place. There was one soft place here, in
the angle of a little bay, with earth and wild
plants sloping to the water’s edge, and for
this I made. I thought I was doing it very
nicely, until I felt a heavy blow on the head,
and, just before my eyes closed in a dead faint,
saw the boat, bottom upwards, floating out to
sea. I had missed by a hair’s-breadth, and
brushed a boulder half hidden in the grass.</p>

<p>The moon was up when I came to. I
must have lain there some hours, wedged
comfortably in the brushwood that clung
to the stone, high, and nearly dry again,
though at the outset I was, of course, wet
through. It was a mercy rather than a judgment,
after all. The sea had shot me out of
its own reach, and no one could have been
more considerately stunned. There was a
slight flesh wound on my forehead, but no
bone broken anywhere. I sat up, and brought
my thoughts back to life; then slowly found
my feet, and went to look for my hat. In a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">(37)</span>
few moments I became aware that there were
other things missing, namely, the boat and the
ship.</p>

<p>All were gone. The great stretch of sea
was without a speck. I was alone, abandoned
to starvation or other miserable death. I
threw myself on the ground and sobbed.</p>

<p>What had become of the ship? Alas! my
theory of probabilities was only too easy to
form. They had found the upturned boat,
and perhaps the hat, had jumped to the
conclusion that it was all over with me, and
made off, pursued no doubt, in fancy, by a
fleet of cannibal canoes. And here was I, a
second Robinson, on a lonely shore, without so
much as a wreck to start me in housekeeping.</p>

<p>The rock sloped at this place, as I have
said, and I easily climbed to the summit, and
looked around. I meant to sit down there,
and form plans. But I forgot all about the
morrow, as soon as I saw what nature had sent
me that night. It was the full moon; and to
know what moonlight is you must come to
these Southern seas. I had no print to read,
but I could trace the lines in my palm, and I
was consoled by the observation that my line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">(38)</span>
of life was a long one. Behind me were the
massive shadows of higher hills, before, a tableland
of grass and wild trees, bathed in the soothing
light, and beyond, the molten silver of the
sea fringed with the everlasting surf. The only
landward sound was the soft ‘click, click’ of
some native bird. It was impossible to feel
sad; it was a place to die in, if not to live in,
come what might.</p>

<p>The night was warm, I felt no chill, and I
sat down and thought the thoughts one thinks
in the moonlight. The pity of it that one
should ever take the trouble to be less than
one’s best in this passing flash of life! What
matters the pain for the purchase of this
certain joy—the only joy that is sure, so why
not make the most of it in valour, honour,
fortitude, without waiting for aught sweeter in
the dim beatitudes beyond? So to live as, at
this moment, thou couldst cease to live! It is
the moon’s message, delivered with unfailing
regularity once a month, and her main business
is to deliver it, not to suck up tides. The
shilling almanacs will never contain everything
till they devote a line to this interesting fact.
When the moon gets that message into the soul,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">(39)</span>
all else must make way for it. Stockbroking
seems a pity, in her mildly searching light, with
most other modes of getting on; and no wonder
there is a tradition in Bayswater families that
this kind of natural illumination is bad for the
eyes.</p>

<p>I, too, was not unmindful of a domestic
tradition on the subject; and, when I felt
sleepy, I sought the shade of a hill. I made
my bed of brushwood, and sank down. I
ought to have felt cold, and caught cold, but
I did neither—perhaps the very dews were
pickled by the sea air.</p>

<p>The sun called me betimes next morning,
and I rose at once, painfully hungry, but in
perfect serenity of mind. Now that I saw
more of my new home, I could not think of it
as my grave. Before me, to the north east,
rose the tremendous peak we had sighted
from the sea. The hills into which it sank at
its base stretched right across the island,
forming a ridge at right angles to the other
previously seen from the ship. I was thus
shut in a corner, and I could see nothing of
what lay beyond. I might have seen more
by mounting the hill, but I seemed to dread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">(40)</span>
to do it. I thought I would follow the coast
line, from a vague idea that it would be safer
to have the sea at hand. There was no sign
of human life, but the air was alive with
myriads of sea birds, wheeling about the rock.
The fly catchers, darting through the air
for breakfast, added to the animation of the
scene, but, of course, made me feel hungrier
than ever. There was a distant prospect of
a meal, however, in the wild goats looking
down on me from the hills—in grave wonder,
I hoped, at their first sight of a man. Early
as it was, tiny lizards darted about at my feet
in evident distress of mind.</p>

<p>Always skirting the rock, I came soon
to another peak, lower than the one first
seen, but still awful in its sheer fall of six or
seven hundred feet right into the sea. I lay
down, to peep over the almost perpendicular
wall, and rose again with a sense that I
and my island were going to be very cosy
together, and all to ourselves. Then, lifting
my eyes to the highest summit beyond me, to
measure the breadth of our domain, I saw a
human shape, standing clean and clear and
quiet on the verge, against the cloudless sky.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br>
<span class="title">RESCUE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">It was a woman—so much I could make out,
in spite of the distance, some three hundred
yards as the crow flies, though more, of
course, by the dip between the two hills—a
woman, by the rounded contours of the
silhouette, and a tall one. Of her face, I
could as yet say nothing: she was looking
out to sea.</p>

<p>A woman, then, but of what tribe? There
was no telling by the dress. She wore a
petticoat of some dark material, reaching to
the knee. It was but a dark patch, of course,
as I saw it; and above it was the white one
of another garment. At first, that was all
I made out—the patch of dark, the patch of
white, with the half tint that stood for her
bare limbs. She seemed to be shading her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">(42)</span>
eyes with her hand, as she stood in the glare
of light.</p>

<p>Suddenly she wheeled round, as though
to descend the peak, and, in doing it, saw me.
We were now face to face, she on the higher
summit, I on the lower, with only the valley
between us. I could not see her features,
but she seemed rooted to the spot with astonishment.</p>

<p>I instinctively felt for a weapon. I expected
a scream or a signal, and savage
warriors trooping over the hill. But she
made no sign. Hesitation was out of the
question: I moved straight towards her. I
had no beads about me for a peace-offering,
so I fumbled at my watch chain, and
wrenched off a propitiatory pencil-case that
I hoped might serve.</p>

<p>She advanced too. Then, at every step, the
bands of light and dark began to develop into
the most majestic shape of youthful womanhood
I had ever seen. The white was evidently
a sleeveless undergarment reaching, like the
petticoat of deep blue, no further than the
knee. The naked arms, legs, and feet were
no darker than the cheek of a brunette.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">(43)</span>
The chemise was low, and above it rose the
glorious bust, almost as broad as a man’s,
and with a virgin firmness of line that was
strength and softness too. She was very tall
for her sex, tall even for mine, but the perfect
proportion between body and limbs took
off all effect of ungainliness. She moved with
the beautiful poise and precision of a mountaineer,
brushing hillock, tuft, and boulder in
the slope, as though they formed but one
level.</p>

<p>Would she attack? It looked so, else
why had she met my advance so boldly, without
calling her tribe? She seemed to have
taken the measure of me for single combat.
She would have been a formidable foe, in any
case, to say nothing of the handicapping in
respect for the sex.</p>

<p>But there was no more of aggression than
there was of flight in her attitude, as she
paused at last, when but a few feet parted us,
and looking down on me in placid wonder,
from large and lustrous eyes, showed me the
peculiar beauty of her face. Her features
were regular, without being faultlessly, or
rather, faultily so. Her complexion would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">(44)</span>
have passed muster for fairness in Provence,
if not farther north. The only signs of race
type were in a certain prominence of the
brow, and in the deep liquid softness of the
gaze. I had seen such eyes in some of the
Coral Islands, and I used sometimes to wish
we could take a pair of them back with us,
to put the Italian women out of conceit with
their own. Her lips were rather full and
sensuous, but this did not impair the tender
dignity of her expression. Her dark hair,
shining, I regret to say, with some native oil,
which, even at a distance, I could perceive
was scented, seemed to have been caught up
with one sweeping gesture, and gathered in a
knot behind. Her feet were rather large,
though perfectly formed; and she had drawn
them close together, as she paused, like a
child toeing the line in school. To complete
the similitude, she stood perfectly straight,
with her arms folded behind her, and her
head thrown back—her bosom, the while,
gently rising and falling with excitement but
half suppressed, and carrying with it, in its
motion, her sole ornament, a common English
navy button, fastened with ribbon to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">(45)</span>
throat. I had looked on other women as
beautiful in feature, but never on one so
magnificently formed. It recalled poetic
ideals of the youth of the race.</p>

<p>Evidently she was waiting for me to
say something, but how was I to say it?
The whole Melanesian mission might have
been at fault in the speech of this solitary
isle. So I began toying with the pencil-case
once more, and then, in a desperate attempt
to recall some characters of a universal sign
language, I folded my hands on my breast—as
I had once seen it done by savages of
wilder aspect, in a ballet in Leicester Square.</p>

<p>No language in the world could do justice
to my astonishment at what followed, and
therefore I set it down without comment, just
as it passed.</p>

<p>‘You speak English, I suppose,’ said the
girl. ‘How did you come on the Island?’</p>

<p>The accent was as pure as yours or mine;
in fact, there was no accent; and the voice
was as soft as the eyes.</p>

<p>For some moments I could utter no word.
I went on with the sign language, but then,
only to pass my hand over my brow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">(46)</span></p>

<p>‘Who are you? and how did you come
here? We saw no ship from the Point!’</p>

<p>‘Madam, I——’</p>

<p>The gravity of the features relaxed, and
the girl laughed.</p>

<p>‘I knew you spoke English; but why
won’t you go on? Oh, how stupid I am!
You are faint and ill. Lean on me, and come
and have something to eat.’ In another
moment she was by my side, with one
strong arm round me, and nearly lifting me
off the ground, in the attempt to help me
to walk—a most humiliating reversal of
protective rôles.</p>

<p>‘I can walk perfectly well, thank you;
please let me go,’ I had to say, like some coy
schoolgirl in the grasp of a dragoon. It was
very ridiculous, but I really could not get free.</p>

<p>‘Very well, then, but I will carry you
when you like. Now, tell me who you are,
and please don’t call me Madam again.
Victoria is my name—after the Queen—“Victoria.”’</p>

<p>—‘By the grace of God,’ I could not help
thinking, remembering what I had feared, and
what I had found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">(47)</span></p>

<p>‘Victoria, I was nearly dashed to pieces
on these rocks last night.’</p>

<p>‘Where is your ship?’</p>

<p>‘It was over there, but it has sailed away.’</p>

<p>‘On the south side. But don’t you know
that the landing-place is on the north?’</p>

<p>‘I know nothing. I never thought to
find a living, still less a civilised, soul in this
place. Tell me where I am.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t seem to know much geography,’
she said, with an offended air. But
she was mollified in a moment. ‘How faint
you must be! Lean on me. If you don’t, I
will carry you, whether you like it or no.
Poor thing!’</p>

<p>I wanted no support, but I was nothing
loath to lean upon Victoria. So we walked
away, with an arm round each other’s waist,
as innocently affectionate as the primal pair.</p>

<p>She led me towards another slope of the
Peak, and, all too soon for me, with such
leading, we reached the top.</p>

<p>The whole island lay before me, from sea
to sea, quivering with life in the morning sun.
In its irregular outline, it seemed like some
quaint sea monster that had shot up from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">(48)</span>
depths of the Pacific to take a look round,
and that might instantly disappear. It was
head and shoulders out of the water, joining
the sea almost everywhere at the base of
perpendicular rocks rising to heights of from
four to six hundred feet, and it had little or
no beach. On all sides, the wave seemed in
fretful strife with the rock, but beyond the
broken lines of surf lay the calm of the immeasurable
ocean, with nothing in the way, it
seemed, between this and the next world.
The range of hills cutting the island in half from
east to west sloped to the edge of the cliff; on
the southern side, in deep valleys, filled with
plantation plots; on the northern, into two
terraced spaces, one above the other, commanding
a view of the sea. On the highest
of these lay a settlement of civilised men, its
cottages lapped warm, like birds in their
mosses, in exquisite vegetation—palms, and
banyans, and cocoa-nut trees, and, as I might
guess, by what was nearer to the view, passion-flowers,
and trumpet vines, and creeping
plants of infinite variety, the rich growth
clothing even the adjacent summits and hillsides,
and the sharp inaccessible slopes, right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">(49)</span>
down to the water’s edge. Below the settlement,
on the lower terrace, was a grove of
cocoa-trees, with no habitation, and below this
again, a little bay, evidently the landing-place,
and the only one on this cruel shore.
All this beauty of nature and homely sweetness
of ordered life, lying to the north of the
dividing ridge, had been hidden from me in
my rude landing-place, even the cultivated
valleys being shut out by a transverse section
of the rock.</p>

<p>We were still standing on the hill when,
from a clump of cocoa at its foot, a little girl
came running towards us—a reduced copy, to
scale, of Victoria, in build and strength and
perfect animal grace. Without standing in
the least upon ceremony, she gave me a most
hearty kiss, and asked me my name.</p>

<p>‘I wonder now if you could read it,’ I said,
feeling in my pocket for the card-case which
I had kept by me in all my wanderings, and
extracting from it a card that showed woeful
traces of the ducking of the night before.
The little one’s eyes dilated in wonder as she
read the inscription, and in one swift glance
took me in from head to foot. Then she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">(50)</span>
turned, and started for the village, at breakneck
speed down the steep incline, shouting
as she went, ‘Mother! mother! Here’s a
lord!’</p>

<p>In a few moments she was mounting the
hill on the other side, to the first terrace, and
I lost her for a moment in the cocoa grove.
She emerged into the second steep path that
led to the settlement, still uttering her strange
cry. I could see the doors opening, the
people turning out, the terrified flutter of
domestic fowl.</p>

<p>‘Come!’ said Victoria, and she strode on
in the track of the child, turning now and
then to help me. We soon reached the level
of the grove, a majestic scene, roofed with
branches, and carpeted with shrubs spangled
with the sunshine that shot through the trees.</p>

<p>I sank down in the delicious shade, not
caring to go farther, not caring to speak. I
was more faint than ever, for, in spite of the
excitement of the adventure, my long fast
began to tell.</p>

<p>An opening in the trees showed the path
to the settlement, with fifteen or twenty
villagers trooping down under the leadership<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">(51)</span>
of the infant herald, who waved them on with
my card. There were women and children,
and, this time, men, most of the latter fit
mates for Victoria in frame and stature.
Their shirts were armless, their trousers
reached only to the knee, all beyond was
bare bronzed skin. They looked all strength,
suppleness, and abounding health.</p>

<p>A dozen began to talk at once. ‘How
did you get him, Victoria?’—‘All last night!’—‘Oh,
the poor thing!’—‘How white his skin
is!’—‘Is he a real lord?’—‘Let me give him
a kiss!’—‘Has he had his breakfast?’—‘He
must stay with us.’—‘No, you had the last
one.’—‘With me!’—‘Me! Me!’—It was
like a clamour of children, but it was stilled
in a moment on the arrival of an elder, dressed
rather differently from the others, and for
whom they all made way.</p>

<p>‘Father,’ said Victoria, addressing the old
man, ‘I won’t give him up to anybody. I
found him, and he belongs to me.’</p>

<p>‘Take him to my house,’ said the Ancient,
‘and none of you speak a word to him till he
has had something to eat. Here, Reuben,
lend a hand;’ and he nodded to a young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">(52)</span>
fellow standing at least six foot two, who lifted
me to my feet as one might lift a child.</p>

<p>It was time, for their talk began to come
to me like a far-off buzzing. I walked as in
a dream, but I was aware of a hushed crowd,
a beautiful path through the trees, a green
lawn on the summit, bordered on three sides
with houses of dark wood and thatch, embowered
in gardens that scented all the air.
Into one of these houses I was taken, and
laid on a comfortable couch.</p>

<p>‘Where am I?’</p>

<p>‘Hush!’ said Victoria. ‘You are in the
house of the chief magistrate of Pitcairn.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br>
<span class="title">BEARINGS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Pitcairn! I remembered something of what
the word meant, next morning, when I woke
from a refreshing sleep.</p>

<p>Who does not know that story, just a century
old? A ship of war from England sent
out to these southern seas to fetch breadfruit
for transplantation. Her work easy, her crew
passing long delicious enervating months in this
contrasting clime; the southern sky, in lieu of
our murky heavens, the southern woman, in
lieu of Deptford Poll. Then, the breadfruit all
collected, the signal given to start for home,
but given by an unpopular commander.
Mutiny next. The captain and a faithful
remnant thrust into an open boat, with a handful
of provisions; the crew gently sailing
away in search of some happy isle. One
group thinking they had found it in Otaheite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">(54)</span>
and there disembarking, leaving the others to
steer further forward into the unknown. These
last, finally, spying the dot of Pitcairn, and
stopping there, scuttling their ship to signify
‘Good-bye’ to the world. An auspicious
settlement, with all the comforts—the heathen
woman (imported) and heathen whisky, home
made, by an inventor of genius, who could
not find even this morning light sufficiently
exhilarating without his dram; a few native
men for service, beside. So, they began to
be happy for ever, according to the most
approved methods of Wapping Old Stairs.
Meanwhile, the captain and his faithful remnant,
in the open boat, make the best of their
way to England, through sun and storm;
their first halting stage, and nearest prospect
of relief and refreshment, twelve hundred
leagues away, their rations weighed to the
twenty-fifth fraction of a pound, and a cocked
pistol always ready for service between the
rotting bread and the famished crew. Home
at last; the story told; and another war ship
sent out to the Pacific, to pick up the mutineers.
The Otaheitan settlers, or what is left
of them, caught and brought back to hang,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">(55)</span>
or otherwise pay their score; the Pitcairners
never found by the avenger, though she rakes
the seas for them for months. Nothing heard
of them for close on twenty years, when, one
day, in the following century, a Yankee
skipper, ranging the smooth ocean, finds this
speck of volcanic eruption on its face; and
then the whole story comes out. We left them,
it may be remembered, with liquor and ladies,
sunshine and a solitary isle, the honestest
attempt ever made to realise the nautical
ideal—said sometimes to extend to other professions—of
a paradise ashore. Alas! it still
was not enough. There had been wild debauchery
in both kinds; riot and midnight
murder; sudden and crafty slayings, to the
confusion of all method in the butcher’s art,
of men by women, women by men, Englishmen
by natives, and contrariwise, then, of
Englishmen, among themselves. At last, only
one man is left, and he of our stock, with
twelve native women in his guardianship, and
nineteen children, most of them fathered by
the Englishmen dead and gone. This man,
struck with horror and remorse, takes a turn
to piety, and, knowing nothing of heredity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">(56)</span>
is simple enough to believe that God gives the
race a fresh start with every generation. So
believing, he reclaims this spawn of hell to
Christianity and civilisation, and makes a new
human type. Other varieties may yet be
found in the stars; this one owned a virtue
that almost ignored evil, and that was well
nigh as effortless as the love of light. It was
strong and gentle, truthful and brave, by fine
instinct; it had an untaught facility of laughter
and of tears; was passionate in loving, yet
strange to violent hate—an image of character
that cast no shadows, the most wonderful
curiosity in life.</p>

<p>The Yankee skipper soon made his strange
discovery known, and then this colony of half-castes
became the pets of the world. English
war ships went to visit them, this time not for
vengeance, but to carry them all whereof they
stood in need, in loving gifts. French war
ships looked in, and, charmed with their innocence
and simplicity, deigned to give them
leave to hoist a Gallic flag, but showed no
resentment when the offer was declined.
America opened her generous hand. It was
a place of pilgrimage; mankind seemed to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">(57)</span>
much that it might have been in this outlandish
folk, without a war, a debt, a slave class,
or a bottle of brandy to boast of, but only
with labour and love. So much had been
omitted, from sheer defect of memory and
knowledge in that poor stranded tar. He had
just tried to make them good, and had left the
rest to take care of itself. Suppose he had
come earlier, and caught the whole race
on their exit from the Ark. How it might
have spoiled history—all the devilment of the
world cleared off, and a new start made with
a germ of good! Well, they multiplied,
with this encouragement, till their numbers
threatened to exceed the capacities of the isle,
when a considerate British Government transported
them to another island, ever so far
superior, and set them up in housekeeping.
They flourished; but the new island was the
great world, and the gentler spirits among
them sighed for their worldlet once more. So
these came back to it; and their children and
children’s children are here, in the old peace
and beauty of life, to this day.</p>

<span class="title">SETTLING DOWN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">So much I remember of my reading, and I
slowly bring it back to life, with much help
in concentration from one of the rafters
of yellow wood with which my chamber is
roofed. I am steadily gazing at the rafter,
as I have been any time this hour past, when
I hear a knock at the door, give the familiar
pass-word, and receive Victoria’s unembarrassed
‘Good-morning’ as she walks majestically
in, and takes a seat on the edge of the
bed. I watched her savage cheek for the
trace of a blush, but there was none. I hope
she did not watch mine.</p>

<p>‘Must we call you “Lord”?’ she inquired,
with grave politeness. ‘Father says we ought,
but I thought I would ask you first.’</p>

<p>I set her mind at rest on this point, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">(59)</span>
then she became herself of yesterday, protecting
and calm.</p>

<p>‘I came to call you. How long have you
been awake? Did you sleep well?’ So many
questions, one might say, out of an Ollendorffan
First Course in the language of the
island.</p>

<p>‘Delightfully,’ I replied. ‘I hope I have
not kept breakfast waiting.’ (Exercise No. 2.)</p>

<p>‘Oh, we have had breakfast long ago,’ said
Victoria, now beginning real talk, ‘and they
have all gone to work; but I stayed at home
to look after you.’</p>

<p>‘What kind of work?’</p>

<p>‘Well, work in the plantations—how do
you suppose we get our yams?’</p>

<p>‘What else?’</p>

<p>‘Listen’—and I heard a muffled sound of
beating from the back of the house. I had
heard it before, but it had passed unnoticed—‘Can’t
you guess what they are doing there?’</p>

<p>‘Not in the least.’</p>

<p>‘They are making cloth, tappa cloth. See,
here is some of it;’ and she showed me the
snowy counterpane of my bed. ‘We make it
from the bark of a tree. I’ll show you, by-and-by.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">(60)</span>
We like English cloth better, though,
when we can get it. I always dress in English
cloth.’</p>

<p>‘So you have done no work to-day, Victoria,
all because of me.’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, I have. I have cooked your
breakfast, and caught it too. Do you like
fish?’</p>

<p>‘What fish?’</p>

<p>‘Squid.’</p>

<p>‘I hope I do,’ I said fervently—‘I am
sure I do.’</p>

<p>‘Such fun! I had to go in three times for
him, and was washed off twice.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t quite understand.’</p>

<p>‘In the surf, you know. They cling to
the rocks; and you have to catch them before
the sea comes back and catches you.’</p>

<p>I remembered my dismal attempt to rule
the waves the night before last, and was
silent with humiliation.</p>

<p>She must have read my thoughts with
her clear eye. ‘Oh, none of <em>you</em> can swim;
and no wonder—you have such nice ships to
swim for you. I must give you a few lessons.
We will go right round the island—I will look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">(61)</span>
after you. But not till you are stronger.
Are you strong to-day?’ asked Victoria, with
the tenderest solicitude, looking down on me
as on a babe in its cot.</p>

<p>Upon my word, I thought she was going
to offer to dress me. ‘As a lion,’ I returned,
determined to resist this last indignity to the
death.</p>

<p>‘Well, make haste, and get up,’ said
Victoria, and she rose and walked out—no
better enlightened as to the proprieties, I am
afraid, than when she came in.</p>

<p>I was soon in the next room; and for
some minutes I had it to myself. This gave
me time to look round. It was a long
chamber, with windows on one of the longer
sides, or rather unglazed openings that might
be closed with a shutter. On the opposite
side were two beds in recesses facing the
light, and screened by sliding panels that
made each recess a tiny bed-chamber. Portholes
in the wall above the beds would admit
light when the panels were closed. They
were not closed now; and the beds, with
their coverlets of spotless tappa, formed no
insignificant part of the furniture. It appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">(62)</span>
to be the great common room of the house,
serving all purposes by turns. My breakfast
things, spread on a white cloth, stood
on the table. There was a large clothes
press in one corner, of home make, I should
say, but still the work of a craftsman. An
old-fashioned writing-desk, in another corner,
was evidently from Europe. Floor, walls,
and ceiling were of the yellow wood already
noticed. There was no fireplace; but a
well-stored bookcase hung over what might
have been the mantel. In other respects, the
place was like a cabinet of curiosities. There
were articles of use or ornament that must
have come out of the old scuttled ship, with
others that were, as clearly, recent gifts from
Europe. Some of the gifts were useful; a
few would have been purely ornamental, even
in the boudoir of a duchess. There was a
good timepiece, side by side with a machine
for moistening postage stamps. A copper
tea-kettle divided the honours of a little sideboard
with a miniature chest of drawers, in
morocco leather, for the storage of cash—labelled
‘Gold,’ ‘Silver,’ ‘Notes,’ in letters
richly embossed. A huge shoehorn in ivory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">(63)</span>
tapering to a button hook in polished steel,
hung against the wall, near an old-fashioned
native club. Kind-hearted people at home
seemed to have had happy thoughts about
the Pitcairn plunders while walking down
Bond <span class="cor" title="Source: Srteet" id="cor63">Street</span>, and to have rushed into the first
fancy-shop, and bought the first thing that
came to hand. The islanders were none the
worse for it; they had received these gifts
as so much European fetich, and reverently
laid them by, without attempting to discover
their use.</p>

<p>I was still enjoying this strange feast of
the eye, when the Ancient of yesterday, the
Governor of the Island, came in. He was
between fifty and sixty, tall, straight, and
strong, and, in many points of look and
manner, a strange survival of the old-fashioned
man-of-war’s man, though he might never
have trod a vessel’s deck. He was dressed
like a seaman, in blue pilot cloth with brass
buttons, that must have come from England.
He had the inheritance of a pigtail and side
locks, in his way of trimming his hair.
He was no swarthier than an English tar
who has seen service, in spite of his cross of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">(64)</span>
native blood. He had softer manners, however,
than one would look for in his great
original. Yet, to say the best for him, he
came somewhat short of the common conception
of a Governor. His face had something
of the grave beauty of Victoria’s, without
any trace of its spiritual <span class="cor" title="Source: charm," id="cor64">charm.</span></p>

<p>—‘Hope you are better, sir,’ said his Excellency,
laying his hat on the writing-desk,
and holding out his hand. One thing especially
charmed me in him, as, afterwards, in all
of them. He was as free as a Spanish peasant
from all subservience of manner born of a
sense of difference in social grade. None of
them seemed to know their station, although,
strangely enough, this implied no ignorance
of their Catechism. The secret of my unfortunate
position at home, as revealed by
the visiting card, made me an object of
curiosity, but not in the least of deference,
still less, if possible, of ill will. They seemed
to feel without explanation—what I was at
first so anxious to tell them—that it was no
fault of mine.</p>

<p>After compliments, he gave me his history,
in reply to my eager questions. He was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">(65)</span>
grandson of an English mutineer; and both
his father and mother were of mixed English
and native blood. So, too, was his wife—now
dead. Victoria was his only child. The very
mention of her, I could see, brought a faint
glow of pride to his bronzed cheek; and
when she came in, bearing a smoking dish
for my breakfast, he embraced her as lovingly
as though they had not met for months.</p>

<p>‘Be careful, father, or you’ll upset the
bird,’ said the girl, as she laid a baked fowl
on the table, which was quite a master-piece
as a colour study in luscious browns. It took
three journeys to complete her preparations;
and then I was invited to sit down to the
most deliciously novel repast ever spread
before me—grey mullet, and the mysterious
squid, now turning out to be the more familiar
cuttle-fish, to take off the sharper edge of
appetite; the baked bird, with yams, roasted
breadfruit, and plantain cake to follow;
bananas, oranges, and cocoa-nuts for dessert.
The liquors, I am bound to say, were a failure.
I was offered water with the fish, and cocoa-nut
milk with the bird; and, I suppose, my
passing spasm of pain caught Victoria’s eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">(66)</span></p>

<p>‘I knew he would never like it,’ she said
to her father, ‘I must make him some tea,
this minute,’ and she flew outside once
more.</p>

<p>I followed, with a bunch of bananas in my
hand, to entreat her not to execute her kindly
intention, and then I discovered that the
kitchen was in the open air. It was the old
Otaheite oven, described by Cook—heated
stones in a hole in the ground, the food laid
on them, and covered with more heated stones,
which, in their turn, were covered with leaves
and cleanly rubbish to keep out every particle
of cold. Half an hour in this bath of hot air
cooks a fowl to perfection. Other things were
new and strange to me. The houses stood
about a yard above the soil on huge sleepers
of stone, and these sleepers, again, were laid
on low terraces of earth, for further security
against damp. Each house was surrounded
by its own plot—a garden in front, and in the
rear a miniature farm-yard, and offices, including
the oven, and a shed for the making
of cloth. The roofs were thatched with
leaves, and most of the dwellings had an
upper floor.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<span class="title">GOVERNMENT, ARTS, AND LAWS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Victoria goes afield, and I return to the house,
to smoke with the Ancient, and to interview
him on government, arts, and laws. This is
what I learn.</p>

<p>Our population, men, women and children,
is less than one hundred souls.</p>

<p>Our arts—well, we till the soil, as aforesaid,
but in our own way. The plough and
the windmill were unknown to us a few years
ago. We breed a little stock, and we exchange
wool and tallow for flour and biscuit,
with passing ships. When a ship comes to
us, we grow wild with joy, and it is fête day
throughout the island.</p>

<p>We get most things in this way, and our
latest transaction in barter was for slate pencils
and files, of which we stood much in
need. The school was reduced to chalk and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">(68)</span>
the blackboard. For a long time, we were
greatly at a loss for wedding rings; and the
one ring on the Island had to be lent for each
successive ceremony. This want is now supplied.</p>

<p>Coin is a curiosity: we have but two
sovereigns, a dozen half-crowns, with a choice
assortment of minor pieces, and one fourpenny
bit. This last stands under an inverted tumbler,
which constitutes our nearest approach
to a numismatic museum. The collection
might increase, if only the ladies could consent
to part with their jewelry, for our few
English coins are worn as ornaments. There
are American dollars in greater plenty, but
the currency is chiefly in potatoes.</p>

<p>We think of raising cotton, which would
thrive very well in this latitude, and it is
quite possible that, in a few years, we may
be no longer dependent on Europe for shirts.
It would add much to our sense of dignity,
and, beside, would tend to make us more self-supporting,
in the event of complications with
a foreign power.</p>

<p>We have no navy to speak of, but there
is a first-rate whale boat. The steersman of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">(69)</span>
the whale boat is also Magistrate, or Governor
of the Island—my host. There is precedent
for it: Pitt, I believe, was First Lord of the
Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer,
at the same time. The Governor is elected
annually, by universal suffrage of both sexes.</p>

<p>O that Governor!</p>

<p>He has just laid down his pipe, to fish the
Revised Statutes out of the pocket of his pilot
coat. ‘We make ’em as we want ’em,’ he
says simply, ‘but I hope we shall soon want
no more. There’s quite enough already, to
my mind.</p>

<p>‘You see, sir, the first is a “Law Respecting
the Magistrate” (that’s me, for the
present). He’s to carry out the laws, and
when there’s any complaint to call the people
together and hear both sides. Everyone is
to treat him with respect. But they all do,
you know, without that,’ his Excellency was
pleased to add.</p>

<p>‘Then there’s a “Law Regarding the
School.” All children to go; or to pay,
whether they go or not. Fee, a barrel of
Irish potatoes a year, or thereabouts.’</p>

<p>‘A barrel of Irish potatoes, you see, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">(70)</span>
our currency, stands for twelve shillings,
and the school fee is a shilling a month. A
barrel of sweet potatoes is only eight shillings.
Three good bunches of plantains make four
shillings, and so on.</p>

<p>‘On the 1st of January we visit landmarks,
first thing after the election, and see
they are all right.</p>

<p>‘Then there’s a law about drinks, sir—as
I dare say you know. No strong liquor on
the Island, except for physic. You see, we
gave liquor a trial when our people first
came here, and the man that invented it went
funny, and jumped into the sea. It seemed
to bring bad luck, so we gave it up.</p>

<p>‘Now we come to our great difficulty,’
and he proceeded to read aloud another
chapter of the statutes headed, ‘Laws for
Cats.’ ‘Cats, you must know, sir, are very
useful in keeping down rats, but our young
people will sometimes shoot them for sport,
so we’ve been obliged to pass a very severe
law, our severest, I may say. There’s a heavy
fine for killing a cat, half of it to go to the
informer. For all that, it’s no easy matter
to settle these cases. Sometimes people say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">(71)</span>
the cat came to kill their fowls; and what
are you to do then? It is a difficult case for
a magistrate. I always say this—was the cat
caught killing the bird; or was it merely a
suspicion? If you can’t produce your
dead bird, then down with your potatoes!
There’s another way; you may pay your fine
in rats killed by yourself. Three hundred is
the price of a cat’s life; we try to be fair all
round.</p>

<p>‘Take fowls again; if a fowl trespasses in
your garden, you may shoot it, and the owner
must return you your charge of powder and
shot. That’s the law as it stands in the book,
but nowadays you generally send back the
bird, and say no more about it. We are all
neighbours, you know.</p>

<p>‘There’s another thing,’ continued his
Excellency, pursuing his commentary on the
code, ‘You mustn’t carve on trees. Who
wants to carve on trees? you may say. Well,
the young people, when they are a-courting.
But it ruins the timber. We’ve had no end of
trouble with that law. As you walk about
the Island, sir, you’ll come upon true lovers’
knots, and such like, in the most out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">(72)</span>
way places. You mustn’t be startled by ’em,
and think it’s savages; it’s just sweethearts,
neither more or less. Where we can’t tell
which pair was walking there, I draws ’em
all up in line, and asks who did it, straight
out. Oh, you have to look sharp after things
here, I do assure you. Our people are not
so wicked, but they get careless sometimes.
Who’d ever think, now, that we want a “Law
for the Public Anvil”? but we do.’ And he
read aloud,</p>

<p>‘“Any person taking the public anvil and
public sledge-hammer from the blacksmith’s
shop is to take it back after he has done with
it; and, in case the anvil and sledge-hammer
should get lost, by his neglecting to take it
back, he is to get another anvil and sledge-hammer,
and pay a fine of four shillings”—potatoes,
you know.</p>

<p>‘You’ve got a good many more laws in
Europe, I’ve heard say,’ he observed, as he
closed his book, and restored the entire code
of Pitcairn to his breast pocket.</p>

<p>‘You have not been misinformed,’ I replied.
‘But tell me—have you any machinery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">(73)</span>
of appeal from the decisions of the Court of
First Instance?’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ he said, ‘if they don’t like what I
tell ’em, it goes before a jury.’</p>

<p>‘And if they don’t like that any better?’</p>

<p>‘Then we hold over till the next British
man-o’-war touches, and the captain decides.
We’ve got an appeal waiting now—a cat
case. None of us can get to the rights
of it, so we must wait: but the parties are
friendly enough, meanwhile.’</p>

<p>‘Have you ever carried a case to the House
of Lords?’</p>

<p>‘We shouldn’t like to trouble you, sir,
thank you, all the same.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br>
<span class="title">NURSE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Victoria is my nurse. There is no doubt
of it: I am in her charge. She governs
all my goings out, and my comings in, and
is told off, I think, to see that I do not
drown myself, or fall off the rocks. For
a few days I see next to nothing of the
others. They are gone out to work long
before I get up, and I catch mere glimpses of
them in our walks afield. They come up in
the evening, to look at me through the
windows, but Victoria heads them off, with a
promise to produce me on Sunday. I am
supposed to be convalescent in the meanwhile.
I am quite content, and I sham.</p>

<p>The housewives, of course, see me, as I
walk through the village. They have all
kissed me, nobody objecting, I least of all. I
am the best of friends with the children, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">(75)</span>
these always call me ‘Lord.’ Victoria calls
me by my Christian name.</p>

<p>She wakes me in the morning, feeds me
as aforesaid, then takes me for an airing, perhaps
to St. Paul’s Point, a thousand feet high,
which affords a fine bird’s-eye view of infinitude.
When the ascent becomes unusually
steep, she grasps me by the arm, and pushes
me up. It is useless to try to shake her off;
I need her as much in that country as Gulliver
needed Glumdalclitch elsewhere. The
goats can hardly follow us sometimes. Her
education has been neglected in the matter
of nerves; she stands on perpendicular summits,
and coils her hair; she drops on ledges
of rock less than a yard wide, to rescue a
stray kid, and walks to and fro on them with
a certitude that precludes courage. Never
have I felt so small. There is nothing to keep
up the fiction of knightly service, not a fan to
hold, a carriage door to open, a wrap to arrange.
So I make no more pretence of homage
to the sex than any other infant in charge.
Fractiousness, on the contrary, is rather my
cast of mind; if anything, I am a troublesome
child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">(76)</span></p>

<p>In all things she is a model nurse, and
especially in this, that she teaches me to tell
the truth. I had no idea of what truthfulness
might mean, till I came here. Victoria never
says the thing that is not, and she sometimes
misses the most tempting effects of humour, in
consequence. Her yea is yea, her nay, nay.
So, it seems, the primitive founder from
Wapping understood his charge under the
Writ. Whatever is she states as it is, and
this mere habit often gives her talk the charm
of classic prose. The Ancient, as we have
seen, in his love-knot cases, supplies the want
of a detective police by public confession. I
praised her once for this virtue; she said I
had strange ideas.</p>

<p>It kills coquetry, though. ‘I don’t think
you care for me one bit, Victoria,’ I said one
day. ‘Why should I care for you?’ I, of
course, expected on her part, as the next
move in the game. All the best treatises lay
this down as the appropriate answer. But
Victoria simply played the native gambit. ‘I
am sure I do: I like you very much. How
stupid of me never to think of telling you!
So does father too.’ I threw a stone at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">(77)</span>
goat, by way of changing the subject, and
Victoria redoubled her attentions all the
way home. I could only throw more stones
at the goats. Shooting, alas! was out of the
question: all the live things were stock, and
they had no stock to spare.</p>

<p>She tells me stories, like the best of
nurses, stories of that unregenerate early time,
when evil was killing itself out of the island,
and the Devil stinging himself to death with
the fork of his own tail. There is a story of
an awful night, which I often ask for. All the
native men had risen on all the English, and
left but one of them alive, the future law-giver,
and him half dead. Then, when darkness fell,
the native women stole on the sleeping murderers,
and finished them. This was the last
massacre; the Devil was dead in Pitcairn. The
scene is always with me, as the background of
the picture of to-day. Here the sweet benignant
maids and wives, the sunshine and the peace;
there the dusky furies they sprang from, stealing
forth in the night to the deed of blood.
Love redeemed, if it did not justify; and ah, how
these Southern women possess that finest of the
arts! At Tahiti—it is another of Victoria’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">(78)</span>
stories—when the avenging war ship came out
to fetch the mutineers home to be hanged,
one of them was torn from the side of Peggy,
his native wife, who held an infant at her
breast. He lay heavily ironed on deck, when
Peggy climbed the side, infant and all, from a
canoe—as it was thought, only to say a discreet
good-bye. But Peggy behaved without
discretion, throwing herself on the poor manacled
wretch, hugging his very fetters, to get
a little nearer the father of her baby, and
sobbing the most heart-breaking things to
him in the <i lang="fr">patois</i> of her isle. He turned, and
begged she might be led away, as though he
were already tasting something sharper than
death. Led away she was, and sent back in
her canoe, and she made such haste to die of
a broken heart that she was at peace long
before he went down in his irons in the storm
that nearly destroyed the whole ship’s company,
captives and all, on the homeward
voyage.</p>

<p>Once, it might have been a ghost story.
I am walking with Victoria at night, through
a deep gorge, to show her the scene of my
disaster in the landing. A high ridge bounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">(79)</span>
the valley; and chancing to raise her eyes to
it, the girl suddenly utters a cry of terror,
and clings all trembling to me. ‘Tell me
what it is—I cannot look at it.’ Then, as
suddenly, she flings herself away from me,
cowering, and will not be touched; and, with
hands clasped, utters more cries of mystery,
in which I am not concerned. ‘Oh!—if!—speak
to me, only! come to me! I have
not forgotten, I have not done wrong.’ There
is certainly something stirring up there, in the
green moonlight, but Victoria will in nowise
let me obey her order to find out what it is,
but draws me back into the shadow of the
gorge, and insists on our hurrying home.
Amiable and harmless ghost, the girl is mute
about thee, and I am fain to be content with
thy biography from the Ancient’s lips. The
Ridge is haunted by the phantom of a
murdered chief, another of the victims of that
old wild time. The news of our adventure
spreads through the settlement, and no one
peeps in at the windows that night.</p>

<p>She takes me for walks, too, the cunningest.
There is a wild cave at the western
end, where one of the mutineers, ever haunted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">(80)</span>
by the dread of that avenging ship, used to
entrench himself against possible attempts at
capture that were never made. He would sit
there whole summer days, his eye on a
narrow rim of rock that led to his cavern,
and that one man might, with ease, have kept
inviolate against a hundred. He was provisioned
and stored for a long siege, and a
hard fight; and as he sat watching through
the long hours, no doubt he had his thoughts.
The eastern end has its cave too, another
sanctuary, but of far-off aboriginal man, who
carved sun, moon and stars on its walls, and
then retired into eternal oblivion and the night
of things. The vanished one’s modest avoidance
of publicity could not fail to be remarked,
in spite of him. He had found, or made, his
cavern, in the face of a wall of rock that rose
some six hundred feet sheer from the foaming
sea. A few feet from the summit, there was
a ledge just wide enough to support a man,
and this was the pathway to his chapel of
little ease.</p>

<p>At our first visit, Victoria dropped on the
ledge with the mingled lightness and precision
of fall of a weighted feather, forbidding me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">(81)</span>
to follow, on pain of death. I did follow, in
spite of the prohibition, whereupon she stood
stock still on the ledge, till I could recover
touch of her, and then burst into tears. The
tears saved me, for I was beginning to look
down the wall into the surf, and that way
self-murder lay. They made me look up at
Victoria, though I could not see her face.
She recovered herself in a moment. ‘Now
you will shut your eyes,’ she said, ‘lay both
hands on my shoulders, and walk straight on
after me.’ So we reached the cave, when she
turned and faced me, and began to cry once
more. ‘How am I to get you back? Why,
not all <em>our</em> people can walk here—only the
youngest! I will never take you out again,
<em>never</em>; I mean, <em>perhaps</em> I never will.’ I examined
the curiosities of the cave meanwhile,
and assumed a silent, remorseful air. Then
came the return journey. ‘Try to forget all
about the scolding,’ said Victoria, ‘I take it
back—for the present—and do just as you did
before.’ It was done; and I declare the indefinable
charm of companionship with her in
peril was a sufficient antidote to fear. ‘Now,’
she said, when we reached the end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">(82)</span>
pathway, ‘keep your eyes shut, and hold on
to this till I come to you.’ And she guided
my hand to a small projection, and scrambled,
by what I afterwards found was an almost
perpendicular facet, to the top of the rock.
In a few seconds, something soft touched
my face; it was a long woollen girdle, that
Victoria sometimes wore, and she had lowered
it to my aid. I, too, reached the level
at last. ‘I shall not speak to you for some
time,’ she said, resuming the quarrel, and she
stalked on ahead, I meekly following without
a word. She turned as we reached the path
leading to the settlement. ‘Do you unfeignedly
repent?’ When she was most serious
she often talked the English of the Church
Service, and without the faintest sense of incongruity.
‘Victoria, I can hardly find words—’
‘Very well, then: I forgive you from my heart,
though, you know, I am not obliged to forgive
you till sundown. But it would be a pity to
waste an afternoon.’</p>

<p>We finished the day in great amity, under
the shade of a banyan tree, whither we retired
for consultation on a matter that gave Victoria
some perplexity of spirit. She had lately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">(83)</span>
bought a Milton from a passing ship—with
her own savings in potatoes—and had read it
through so often that she knew long passages
by heart. The work had left in her mind an
impression of unfairness in the treatment of
Satan, and she was most anxious to submit
this difficulty to the judgment of a friend. I
was at first disposed to make light of it, but I
soon saw that Victoria took it very seriously
indeed. They had but few books; each book
went the round of the settlement; and it
was taken in most edifying good faith, as
a report from that visionary outer world,
that unexplored planet, whose laws, customs,
institutions, ways of being and doing were
such a mystery to the worldlet of the rock.
The hero of the latest volume to hand,
novel, history or poem, no matter what its
date, was always the personage of the day at
Pitcairn. His difficulties were the living issues
in politics, morals, and the art of life.</p>

<p>‘I am going to say something about it at
the meeting to-morrow night; but I thought I
should like to speak to you first. I do not
think he was properly treated, though Mr.
John Milton seems to have no pity for him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">(84)</span>
and he ought to know. Yet I cannot think it.
I could hardly sleep at all, last night; it
troubled me so.’</p>

<p>‘Well, Victoria, I suppose he staked his
stake, and lost, and had to put up with the
consequences; that is all I see.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, but perhaps if they had only been
kinder to him, he might have repented. He
was very proud, you know, and there was no
one to soothe him. I think Gabriel was very
haughty and hard with him, and Zephon quite
disrespectful, considering his place. Do you
always approve of Gabriel?’ she asked, with
much earnestness, and looking me straight in
the eyes, as though our friendship depended
on the answer. ‘Surely,’ she said, with rising
warmth, ‘you would never stand up for that
speech at the end of the fourth book. Rulers
should not be so high and distant, just clearing
their throats, and giving their commands,
as though all others were servants. Suppose
father ruled like that—who would obey the
laws? I know Satan felt it. It is a pity he
had no good female angel to take care of him—only
there is no marrying, nor giving in
marriage there: so they say,’ and she sighed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">(85)</span>
‘People may meet again, though, without
marrying,’ she said after a pause, and with
her eyes fixed on the vacancy of sea and sky.
‘Thank God for that! But oh what meetings,
if they have not been true!’ She seemed
to have forgotten Satan for a moment, I
thought, but I soon brought her back to the
case before the court.</p>

<p>‘There was an attempt to bring feminine
influence to bear on him, I believe, but it
hardly turned out well.’</p>

<p>‘When? where? Mr. John Milton says
nothing about it.’</p>

<p>‘No, that comes from another reporter, a
Frenchman. It did not answer. A pitying
angel left Paradise, to come and speak comfort
to him, as he lay writhing on his hot bed.
She was fearful, though compassionate, and
she meant always to keep out of arm’s length.
But her pity drew her too near, all the same,
and he clutched her, and dragged her down.
So runs the tale.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe a word of it,’ said Victoria
firmly, ‘I think he never had a chance. I
shall say so at the meeting; and you back
me up.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br>
<span class="title">SUNDAY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">I was produced on Sunday before the whole
settlement; more strictly speaking, they produced
themselves before me. The villagers
were in the village, for the first time, at my
hour of rising. There was an absolute cessation
from labour, but there was hardly rest.
They were in a flutter of joyous excitement,
and ran from cottage to cottage, as though
they were spreading good news. Yet there
was no news, for who could need telling that
it was Sunday, and that the sky was blue?
For that matter, they needed no excuse to
make free of each other’s houses. Property
in their own roofs seemed the merest accident
among them. One man’s arm-chair was
another man’s arm-chair. They walked in
and out, by the open doors—often into unguarded
dwellings, when the owners were on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">(87)</span>
a visit elsewhere—read the books, smelt the
flowers, touched the harmonium, if they could,
or cared, and came away. When you sought
a man, you went into the nearest cottage;
you never thought of going first to his own,
unless it lay in your path. There was more
of this curious house to house visiting to-day,
because there was more time for it, and because
there was a greater intensity of childlike
happiness in movement and communion—that
was all.</p>

<p>There seemed to be much borrowing and
lending of the Sabbath finery of cleanliness.
If you had no better coat for the day, why,
your neighbour might have one to spare, and
you asked him for it. Victoria lent two loose
gowns, a kind of <i lang="fr">robe de chambre</i> worn on
state occasions over the scanty costume of the
women. At the same time, she went into a
neighbour’s garden, and helped herself freely
to flowers for her hair, our own stock having
suffered from the movements of some four-footed
intruder during the night. If Proudhon
had lived here, he would have written
‘property is vanity,’ the innermost truth.
Victoria was very smart—a new ribbon for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">(88)</span>
the navy button, beside the blossoms inwoven
with her shining locks.</p>

<p>The church was a hut. I have seen St.
Peter’s, too, yet I give this one the preference
for majesty, taking its surroundings into
account. For St. Peter’s, as the best thing in
its quarter, all else meaner, leads nowhere
beyond itself, while this island fane, backed
first by a stately tropic grove, then by a towering
cone of mountain, then by the clouds,
carried the eye from height to height of
beauty and of wonder, right up to Heaven.</p>

<p>We were rather late, and it was all the
better, for now I could take in the whole
population of the island at a glance. They
were mostly of superb physique, men and
women, and Victoria was but one finest
example of them. Reuben, the young giant,
who had helped me on the day of landing, was
another. Among the women, however, some
foolish hat, or trailing skirt, of civilisation
here and there departed from the classic
simplicity of Victoria’s dress. Most of the
men wore shoes, in honour of the day; a few,
like the Ancient, long trousers, instead of the
loose knee-breeches of their working suits.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">(89)</span>
Trousers seemed to be a sign of authority, or
of the beginning of years. The priest, or
ministrant, wore them, and indeed he might
have been entitled to wear two pairs, for, I
think, he was schoolmaster as well. The types
varied from Victoria’s front of Western Europe
to almost pure Tahiti, but always they had
their point of unity in the large soft eyes.</p>

<p>For the service, never had I seen such
fervour, such passion of prayer and praise!
It was the Church of England form, I believe,
but form of any kind was hardly to be recognised
in the melting heat of their zeal.
The poor old Litany seemed like a veritable
audience at the throne of God. The Commandments
came as His voice from our own
mountain, thundering from the summit of the
cone. Our hymns soared after Him to the very
farthest heaven as He retired. One boy’s note,
I think, must have got there first, so clear was
it, so clean and pure and true, with nought
of earth to keep it from the skies. It was a
living faith, no mere specimen of what once
had lived, dried for keeping, and not even
dried in the sun. Here were the true Primitives,
the joyous band of Galilean vagabonds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">(90)</span>
exulting in that new conception of the brotherhood
of man whose secret we have for ever
lost. Solemnity, as we understand it, seemed
far from them; devoutness was swallowed up
in joy. Often they laid their hands affectionately
on each other’s shoulders as they sang:
once I saw two children kiss after a prayer.</p>

<p>I had been completely ignored during the
service, but, when it was over, my turn came.
As we trooped back towards the village, I was
the centre of a questioning crowd. I had
come from England—that was enough, for
England is their great archetype of power,
wisdom, and beauty of life. Needless to say
they have not seen it; I mean, of course, that
circumstance has bound them to their rock.
All that they know as best comes from
England, from the great war ship, which they
regard with almost the wonder of Indians,
down to the harmonium in the cottage. It is
not much to know, but a generous imagination
easily does the rest. England has been
good to them: England, then, is goodness.
She is visibly strong: then she is strength.
She has sent them Bibles; ah! she must be
the Word made Flesh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">(91)</span></p>

<p>So it was one long bewildering inquisition.
Would I tell them of the great churches, the
great wonders manifold of that far-off Isle of
the Saints? What of the rulers and statesmen,
of the bishops, those captains of captains
of the thousands of God, of the choirs of the
faithful—five thousand strong, as they had
heard—hymning Handel under a crystal
dome? They seemed to see human life not at
all as a mere struggle, but as a great race for
a crown of virtue, in which Britain was first,
and their poor island so decidedly nowhere
that she could afford to sink rivalry in unqualified
admiration. I winced, and winced,
and winced again.</p>

<p>‘We are but poor things here, and we
know it,’ said the schoolmaster.</p>

<p>‘You will improve,’ I said kindly.</p>

<p>‘Well, sir, we are always ready to learn;
perhaps you would like to take a service
yourself next Sunday? You are not in orders,
but you have heard the Archbishop of
Canterbury, I dare say.’</p>

<p>‘No, only a bishop now and then.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, what opportunities!’ said Victoria
sadly. ‘We once had a navy-chaplain here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">(92)</span>
but it was four years ago. Though, of course,
that is no excuse for our not being better than
we are.’</p>

<p>‘They say he has fifteen thousand a year
to spend on the poor,’ said the schoolmaster,
returning to the Primate.</p>

<p>‘Yes, he has fifteen thousand a year.’</p>

<p>‘How much would that be in potatoes, let’s
see?’ murmured Reuben, and he withdrew for
an operation in mental arithmetic.</p>

<p>‘I’ve heard of a lady who has made fifty
thousand people happy, all by herself,’ said
one of the women. ‘She’s a baroness.’</p>

<p>‘And that’s not the highest,’ said another,
‘there’s duchesses who must be richer. Oh,
what a country for the poor!’</p>

<p>‘It’s the big churches I’m thinking of,’
observed the schoolmaster. ‘Why, there’s one
that holds six thousand people. Six thousand
people, twice a day! Think of the spread of it!’</p>

<p>‘Them’s the things I want to see,’ said
Reuben, returning, not unoppressed, I thought,
by his weight of potatoes, ‘the big things—St.
Paul’s, the Railway.’</p>

<p>‘You should use the plural form, Reuben,’
urged the schoolmaster gently, ‘the railways.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">(93)</span>
There are dozens of them. Why, there are
three great lines running to Birmingham! I’ve
got a map of it.’</p>

<p>‘And how about the Parliament?’ struck
in the Ancient, pre-occupied, and not unnaturally,
with the question of legislation.
‘Over a thousand people to make the laws; and
at it day and night, too! The moment anything
goes wrong anywhere, there they are,
waiting on the premises, as you may say, to
put it right. We’ve nothing like that here.
Not that we want it either; I only make the
remark.’</p>

<p>This touching disposition to take us in good
faith had no limits. In their quaint conception
of our corporate life, all things existed
to that great end of the crown of virtue.
Nothing was merely neutral or indifferent.
To talk of making people virtuous by Act of
Parliament would, for them, have had none
of the significance of a sneer. What else
were Acts of Parliament for? So, churches
were to promote brotherhood and love, with
no reserves for a Pickwickian sense; armies,
to suppress the wicked. Rank and riches,
as we have just seen, were mere equivalents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">(94)</span>
for more opportunity; if a baroness made
fifty thousand people happy, what might
not a duchess do? The islanders simply
multiplied our means by their own yearnings,
and the product was a colossal sum in
good. Everything seemed to count; from a
question the Ancient put to me as to the
number of cabs and omnibuses in the British
capital, I more than suspect that these, too,
contributed to his grand total. The drivers
were obliging persons whose chief concern
was to give tired Righteousness a lift.</p>

<p>‘I want to see St. Paul’s and the railways,’
murmured Reuben again, in an amended
version, as he wandered away from the group.</p>

<p>Victoria’s wistful gaze went after him:
‘Poor fellow!’</p>

<p>‘Is anything the matter with him, Victoria?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, but he daren’t tell anyone but me;
he wants to go.’</p>

<p>‘To go where?’</p>

<p>‘Out there,’ she said, with a gesture that
was meant to indicate the world at large. ‘He
wants to see it all; he can never rest here.
These things our people talk about with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">(95)</span>
strangers trouble him. He’s venturous; he
must see and know. He was always like
that: he dived two fathoms lower than anyone
else—off the Point, and brought up a
watch from the old ship. No one can follow
him on the rocks. He discovered an island
once—over there. I went to see it: I’ll
take you one day. Now it’s England. He
can never rest here. But, oh! how I dread
it! and, besides, you know, they will never
let him go.’</p>

<p>‘Did he find so much in the first island,
then, that he longs to try the other?’</p>

<p>‘No; only some dry bones in a cave. But
England will be different, of course.’</p>

<p>They prayed and praised, in the exultant
fashion of the morning, all day long—with
due intervals for refreshment. There were
five services, I think, big and little. If there
were not six, it was only because this Sunday
did not happen to fall on the longest day.</p>

<p>‘I hope it is because we love God,’ said
Victoria, ‘but I think it is just as much because
we love one another. Or perhaps it
is to bring Him nearer, so that we may love
Him like the rest. He must not be too far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">(96)</span>
off. I think that is why some of the poor
wild people we read of take so long to convert.
You must show them something, and let them
feel the strong arm, and see the face of human
love. They always want to worship the missionary
first. Why not let them; and then
pass it on, when they get stronger? Do you
know, in spite of all my advantages, I could
sometimes just fall down and say my prayers
to a child, to things even—a rose-tree? It’s
the old wickedness in our blood, I suppose.
But mind, don’t you dare tell anybody; I
should die of shame!’</p>

<p>I had begged to be excused from attendance
at the remaining four services, on the
ground that I preferred an open-air rite; and,
on my assurance that this mode of devotion
had the sanction of British custom, Victoria
had consented to join me. We were wandering,
talking, musing in long silences, picking
wild-flowers, breathing the balmy air, basking
in the warm light.</p>

<p>In one of these reveries I caught a strange
gleam in Victoria’s eyes. ‘Tell me about the
blessed Sabbaths in England,’ she murmured,
placing her hand in mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">(97)</span></p>

<p>O my England, my England! why cannot
I speak of a thing we all must honour so? why,
rather, do I pray for strength to keep the secret
of thy Sabbaths well? Dread day of the division
of classes, weekly vision of the Judgment,
in its utter separation of the social sheep and
goats, never one flock, alas! at any time, but
now so clearly two. In this dark hour of
remembrance, I hear the hoarse clappers of
thy meeting-houses, vainly fanning the stagnant
air in cities of the spiritual dead. I see
thy funereal processions of the elect, wending
to or from the conventicles, past groups of
coster-boys, who wait for the opening of the
houses, and expectorate on the pavement in
patterns of the dawn of decorative art. It is
all before me, the dingy squalor of thy miles
of shuttered marts, the crying contrasts of thy
Sunday finery, more hurtful to the eye than
thy week-day rags! I hear thy muffin-bells
in the deep silences, and thy hawkers’ wail;
and, amid this worst of all spiritual destitution,
the destitution of beauty, I ask myself, what is
it that we have lost; what is it these little ones
have found?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br>
<span class="title">A SAIL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">I was roused next morning by the report of a
gun, followed by a strange commotion in the
village. I had barely time to dress, and join
the Ancient in the sitting-room, when a man
ran in, breathless, to announce a ship off the
Point, and a Queen’s ship.</p>

<p>A Queen’s ship! No wonder the village
was astir. A ship that might fly the Royal
Standard, a ship that was English authority
and English might! No work in the Island
this day!</p>

<p>The Ancient put on his Sunday coat, and
quietly took command. ‘How lucky the
landing is easy this morning! Jonah, hurry
off to the Point, with the white flag, and
signal their cutter “All right!” Quintal,
you go down to the landing, and see them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">(99)</span>
over the breakers. Now, folks, who’s to take
them in?’</p>

<p>It was a call to public meeting on the
question of the entertainment of the officers.
The islanders always claimed this privilege of
boarding and lodging the Queen’s uniform.
Half a dozen heads of families at once offered
to provide for as many guests. There was a
brisk competition for the Captain, who would
have fallen to the Governor <i lang="la">ex-officio</i>, but for
my occupancy of the spare bedroom in his
Excellency’s house. I offered to retire, but
my generous hostess would not hear of it.</p>

<p>‘I found him, father, and he belongs to
me,’ said Victoria, in the terms of that earlier
claim which had sometimes made me suspect
the existence of slavery in the Island. The
blood of the free-born ought to have rushed
to my face in protest against this attempt to
count me as a chattel; but it did not.</p>

<p>The Captain is knocked down to the
schoolmaster; the women hurry away to
light their ovens; the meeting breaks up. Its
dispersed groups, however, form so many subcommittees
of reception, for they talk of
nothing but the comfort and delight of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">(100)</span>
public guests. The only private interest is
represented by the two litigants who have the
case on appeal from a decision of the Island
courts to the supreme tribunal of a British
man-of-war. They are tossing with a parti-coloured
bean, to see which shall open the
pleadings first.</p>

<p>The Ancient, hurrying down to the
landing-place, calls for his whale-boat and
his mariners three, and our navy goes forth
in <span class="cor" title="Source: mod st" id="cor100">modest</span> pride to meet the Queen’s ship.
She is close in-shore, the depth of water
admitting of a near approach; so, when
our Governor boards her, we see all that
passes. His Excellency takes off his hat,
and pulls at a forelock that is not there to
pull. No real one has been pulled in that
family since the time of George III., but the
gesture has survived with them as a sign of
respect. The Captain shakes hands with him,
and presents him to his officers, who do the
same. Then they leave the clean white deck,
flashing light from its polished brasses, and go
below, as though for complimentary refreshments.
On their return, the Governor takes
charge of the ship’s cutter, in which our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">(101)</span>
guests embark. Only a native can dodge the
rocks, rocklets, and surf currents of our bay.
They wait at the back of the rollers till the
look-out man ashore waves his hat; then they
give way with a will, and are hurled in, safely,
on the crest of the wave.</p>

<p>Two of the officers are old friends of mine.
What a little world it is! You would think
all were old friends of the islanders, by the
warmth of welcome. Men, women and children
struggle for a grasp of their hands, and
a girl offers flowers to the Captain. He kisses
her; his officers kiss the other girls: fathers,
brothers, and cousins hurrah approval, and
content.</p>

<p>Then we lead them to the schoolhouse, by
the steep paths, in joyous procession of old
and young. Here the Captain must enter in
the Island register the name of his ship, with
other particulars, and meet a deputation of
the elders, who come to trade. The ship
wants water, yams, and potatoes: we want
hardware. The terms of exchange are settled
according to a written tariff, and the elders
depart, to weigh over the commodities on
their side. They are poor traders, though:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">(102)</span>
yams are scarce at the moment, yet they ask
no higher price for them; nor can I make
them understand that to do so would be to
seek an honest gain. ‘Is there less steel in
the hatchets than there used to be,’ they ask,
‘that we are to give less in yams?’ I remember
that the value of a thing is what it
will fetch, and I tell them so, but they shake
their heads. For the first time, it occurs to
me that these people have no natural turn for
economic speculation; and that, with all their
religion, they may need a missionary of a
kind. A certain finer sense is wanting; but
no more of this just now.</p>

<p>The guests have, meanwhile, been led to
their quarters, the Captain beaming with
affability and good nature. He foresees his
report to the Lords of the Admiralty on the
morals, manners and customs of these innocent
islanders, with the articles thereon in the
daily papers. It is all such a relief after the
official landings of the Pacific station, and the
French polish of the South American dons,
much tarnished by keeping in a torrid clime.</p>

<p>The people are as curious and inquisitive
as children. They draw the officers’ swords,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">(103)</span>
run their fingers along the dulled edges, cry
wonder at the damascened blades. Some of
them have never seen the uniform before:
none can ever see it too often. They have
the fullest confidence in the honour of the
wearers; and they give themselves up to enjoyment,
without a thought of harm. All the
rules governing their intercourse with traders
are suspended. The girls go where they
please, with whom they please: every middy,
even, has his feminine aide-de-camp, and local
guide. The Captain is attended by no less
a person than the Ancient himself, though I
think he would prefer to rough it with his
officers. The Ancient treats him with a fine
courtesy, affecting not to be master in his own
domain.</p>

<p>Nor indeed is he master for the time—at
least on the judicial side. The Queen’s navy,
as already stated, is our court of final appeal
under the constitution; and there is that unsettled
case. It is called on the morrow of
the Captain’s visit, with the cocoa grove for
the seat of the appellate tribunal. The
Ancient offered the schoolhouse, but the Judge
asked why a clearing in the trees would not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">(104)</span>
do as well; and his will was law. It is quieter
than most halls of justice, for the whispers are
lost in the open air. The twitter of the birds
overhead is not so troublesome as an usher’s
cry of ‘Silence in Court.’ The gentle breeze is
hardly an inconvenience, for there are no
papers to blow about; and the perfume which
it brings from the village gardens would be
a distinct improvement to the atmosphere of
Lincoln’s Inn.</p>

<p>I had never quite understood this case,
and no wonder, for it had puzzled all the
courts of the Island. A cat had been killed:
it opened in that way, clearly enough, but,
soon after, the obscurity began. Who killed
the cat? Even here there was broad daylight—one
Elias McCall. Was he justified in the
deed?—Ha! His plea was that the cat had
sought the lives of his chickens, and that, after
losing several of these in successive midnight
raids, he had, at length, sought the life of the
cat. The law of the case is perfectly explicit:
the cat that slays fowl shall itself be slain. But
the proof of murderous outrage must be conclusive:
the cat must be ‘positively detected
in killing’—the Ancient read the statute from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">(105)</span>
his pocket-book, at the request of the Court.
Now, was the circumstantial evidence so
strong as to constitute detection within the
meaning of the Act? The proprietor of the
fledglings, as a truthful man, could say no
more than that the cat had been in the habit
of taking up her station near his hen-coop in
the cool of the evening, and that, on the
morrow of every such visit, he had missed one
or more birds. He had put two and two together,
that was his expression, and finally,
his feelings getting the better of him, he had
‘let go’ at the cat (the Ancient, at this
point, bade him remember in whose presence
he stood), with the result that his brood
thereafter remained intact. On a post-mortem
examination, moreover, he had found a small
feather clinging to the fur. Pressed by the
other side, he was bound in honour to admit
that he had never seen the cat looking at
the hen-coop—on the contrary, her head
was usually turned the other way. She often
sang to herself, as though pre-occupied; and
her movements were so little of a threatening
nature that she was washing her face at the
very moment of the fatal stroke. It was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">(106)</span>
denied that there were many other cats in the
neighbourhood; it was not denied that the
fowls often flew upon the fence where the
cat used to sit, nor that they might there have
left the stray feather found on her person.
With this evidence, the owner of the cat left
his case in the hands of the Supreme Court.
The courts below had decided against him,
the Ancient first, as Chief Magistrate, and
then a jury. Now, the Captain of H.M.S.
‘Rollo’ was asked to give the final award.</p>

<p>That his Honour was troubled was evident
by the frequency with which he asked his
assessor, the First Lieutenant, to give him a
light for his cheroot. The ‘positively detected’
of the statute was his stumbling-block;
we could see that with half an eye.</p>

<p>‘Where did you find the feather?’ he said
at length, ‘near the tail end, where the cat
might have been sitting?’ It was a leading
question, but no one seemed to notice the
irregularity. ‘No, sir,’ returned the murderer,
‘on her cheek, just under the right
whisker.’</p>

<p>‘That settles it, I think,’ said the Judge;
‘she was washing up, after she had eaten the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">(107)</span>
bird.’ ‘Yes, that settles it,’ echoed the First
Lieutenant. ‘That settles it, of course,’ said
the ship’s surgeon, who, as a mere bystander,
had no business to deliver an opinion on the
matter. ‘That settles it,’ said the Ancient;
‘I never thought of asking the question.’
‘That settles it,’ said all the villagers present,
including, strange to say, the owner of the cat.—Judgment
of the courts below confirmed.</p>

<span class="title">THREE DAYS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">Business over, our pleasures begin. They
are to stay only three clear days in all, and
we must make the most of them, putting as
much into every precious hour as though it
were to be our last of joy.</p>

<p>We visit the ship. She invites us to a
party, puts on a little bunting for the occasion,
and fires a gun. Everybody goes. The
Captain is aboard, and makes believe he has
never been ashore, shaking hands with us as
we climb the side, though he left us but an
hour ago. He wears his cocked hat and
epaulettes, by special request; his officers,
too, have not been sparing of their best. His
crew, subdued to the most mealy-mouthed
propriety of speech by such glimpses as they
have had of the Island life, entertain us with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">(109)</span>
a concert. It is the forecastle fiddle and accordion,
with the repertory of the cockney
music-halls. This last seems to lose vitality
on our pure uplands, and to gasp for the
breath of its native fen. Our good folk
listen to ‘Blow me up an apple-tree,’ or
‘Did ’em do it, did ’em, did ’em did ’em do?’
believing it must be right, because it is
English, yet beginning to doubt—not us, however,
but themselves, beautiful first form of
the doubt of candid souls! Some of the songs
are too far away from them for even the
glimmerings of comprehension—the humour
of the mere sordidness of life. ‘Penny paper-collar
Joe.’—Well, they wear no collars;
consequently, they make no paper imitations;
consequently, these cost neither a penny nor
a pound. For the same reason, ‘O father,
dear father, the brokers are in!’ leaves them
stone-cold. ‘What are the brokers?’ whispers
Victoria to me. How curious to have
to expound these elementary things! ‘Hush,
Victoria, not now—when they are gone—it
would take all day. Listen to the ballads
of the people.’ Next it is a fantasia of punning
effects:</p>

<p class="noindent">I tremble: a little more, and the whole
secret will be out, of the murk of mind
in which so many of our brethren live,
while Lord Tennyson is at the tailor’s about
his ermine, and dilettantism attends its monthly
meeting of the Browning Society, and leaves
them in their pen. A little more, and they
may suspect that beauty and taste are all
grown for Mayfair by the Jews, just like the
big pine apples, and that the poet himself is
but one more market gardener for the rich.
This lyre of the slums threatens to kill the
whole pageant; these sewer gases seem to
tarnish the gold lace on the Captain’s hat.</p>

<p>‘How nice it must be to have your
English sense of humour,’ says Victoria, ‘and
to be able to enjoy all these funny things!’</p>

<p>Saved! Once more they have taken the
blame upon themselves.</p>

<p>We wander over the ship; admire the cutlasses
in their racks; fit our heads in the muzzle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">(111)</span>
of a big gun, gravely waiting our turn in file,
under the orders of a corporal; eat cake in the
Captain’s cabin, refuse wine; see everything,
ask foolish questions everywhere. Never-to-be-forgotten
day! A tar dances a hornpipe
for us; three of our girls dance the rhythmic
dance of Tahiti for the tars. The Captain asks
questions about it, and takes notes, always in
view of that report to the Lords of the Admiralty.
Some of us are photographed—no, it
is getting too maddeningly gay! The Ancient
looks grave, and gives the signal for departure.
The cutters are lowered; the little whaler
takes its freight again; the boats dance us
home in the dusk. It is not all over yet;
they send up a rocket and a blue light, to say
‘Good-night,’ as we step ashore. Never-to-be-forgotten
day!</p>

<p>And there are more such days to come—days
when it is our turn, once more, to do the
honours. Our girls take the distinguished
visitors over the Island—to the cave of the
Carvings, the cave of the Watcher, the Point—tending
them carefully on ledge and
summit and declivity, as my nurse tended
me. They try to do without such guidance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">(112)</span>
and come to grief over it, figuring as meanly
as the sinking Cæsar crying for help. The
water sports are just as disheartening. What
stoutest man among us will follow this sea-nymph,
in her sea toilette, plunging into
the breakers with a plank in her arms,
diving and ducking till she comes to the far
side of the hugest wave, then lying flat on
the curling crest, and rolling in with it, till
it breaks in thunder on the rocks? Always,
after the explosion, you look for a mangled
body, and you find only a laughing Venus,
rising whole and perfect from the foam.</p>

<p>Nature herself smiles benignly on the
festival, and contributes to it with great sunsets
that touch the summits of grove and
mountain with indescribable beauty, and harmonise
into perfect peacefulness of association
even the tumult of the breakers in their everlasting
strife with the shore. There are fishings
by torchlight, later on, in the intense
shadow of the rocks; above us, the coruscating
wall of rock towering to the moonlit
heaven; below, the deep, deep water, all
black and horrible beyond our tiny circle of
flame. The cod flock to the light, like their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">(113)</span>
betters, and get speared with a five-pronged
fork for their pains. The girls, who are deftest
at the exercise, look not unlike Britannia on the
halfpenny, as they sit at ease with their forks,
waiting their turn. Now, we paddle out of
the shadow into the silvered sea, and so ashore
to the green. Then there is another concert
(ours this time), with simple songs of meeting
and of parting, mostly of the schoolmaster’s
writing, quired by the voices of virgins, and,
with such rendering—the scene and the hour
also taken into account—pure intuitions of
the deeper significance of life. Impossible to
doubt, after this, that the spirit is to be lord
of the house; that living is the finest of the
fine arts, or nothing; and that such is the
message, delivered through Nature, of the
Unknowable behind the Nature veil.</p>

<p>The Ancient is thoughtful all the while,
thoughtfullest at the hour of the breaking-up
of this great council of the soul, when the
councillors wander away in pairs, and are lost
in the radiant hazes of the night. It is the
last council—to-morrow they go. Our Chief
has led the way to his cottage, and has asked
the Captain to step in on his way home. ‘I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">(114)</span>
wish you gentlemen might never come here,’
he says pleasantly to his guest, ‘or, if you
come, I wish you might never go away. It
is a moment’s pastime for some of you, but,
one way or other, it lasts some of us a lifetime.
“Jack ashore”—I’ve heard of him
from my father’s father; but then he goes
ashore so often. Our girls never forget—that’s
their nature. I’ve known ’em die, sir,
of these visits of a Queen’s ship. They think
it’s only a beginning—your youngsters think
it too, Captain, while the moon shines—I <em>know</em>
it’s an ending, for ever and ever. They’ll never
meet again, sir, in this world—although, at
this very minute, perhaps, they’re a-cutting
love-knots all over the place to make believe
they will.’</p>

<p>The incidental reference to the love-knots
seemed to have set him on a new track of
reflection. ‘It’s a pity to spoil the trees for
nothing, all the same,’ he murmured, ‘and, if
you’ll excuse the liberty, I think I’ll just have
a look round.’</p>

<p>He stole out to watch the public property;
and, by his orders, no doubt, Victoria, who
had lingered in the garden, came in to entertain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">(115)</span>
the guest. Yet Victoria said not a word.
She had been unlike her old self all the time
of their stay; she had become pensive, melancholy,
retiring, joining in none of the diversions,
only looking on, or languidly asking a question
now and then. I felt what service she required
of me, and made the talk—no very difficult
matter, for the Captain and I had many acquaintance
in common. He knew some of my
own people, besides, and was able to tell me
that a young pickle of a cousin, who had taken
to the Navy, had lately joined the ‘Tanis’ for
service on the China station.</p>

<p>‘The “Tanis” was here three years ago,’
said Victoria, very softly, but looking up at
the Captain, I thought, in a rather wistful
way.</p>

<p>‘I know she was; I boarded her at Portsmouth,
when she went out of commission.
They all talked of nothing but your little
Island, and made me long to come here.’</p>

<p>‘You knew the midshipman of the “Tanis,”
perhaps,’ said Victoria, still with her peculiar
‘inward’ air. ‘Where is he now?’</p>

<p>‘What midshipman?’ the Captain very
naturally asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">(116)</span></p>

<p>If Victoria knew the name, she did not
care to give it. ‘He was a tall young gentleman,’
she said with more animation, yet with
a pause to give the Captain time to collect his
thoughts after each item of the inventory;
‘fair—a quick way of speaking—a pleasant
laugh. If you ever heard him sing, you would
be sure to remember him.’ The Captain shook
his head.</p>

<p>‘He fought the battle with the slave-dhow,
on the west coast of Africa.’</p>

<p>‘What battle, my dear girl?’</p>

<p>‘<em>The</em> battle,’ she repeated.</p>

<p>‘Do you mean he was in a boat that ran
down one of those rascally traders? We do
that every day.’</p>

<p>‘He won the battle, that’s all I know,’ said
Victoria. ‘He told me so. I believe they
called him “Curly” in the mess, because they
were jealous of his hair,’ she added, blushing
to find herself forced into these particulars,
but determined to have him recognised.</p>

<p>‘Curly,’ mused the Captain, doing his very
best—‘can’t say I know the name.’</p>

<p>‘He wore a dirk to fight with,’ said
Victoria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">(117)</span></p>

<p>‘They all wear dirks,’ returned the Captain.</p>

<p>‘His laugh was so pleasant!’ She was
repeating herself beyond question, but, perhaps,
it was only to give the Captain one
more chance.</p>

<p>‘No doubt, no doubt!’</p>

<p>‘Yet some liked his smile better.’</p>

<p>‘Some like one thing, some another,’ said
the Captain—feebly, I thought, but he was
hard pressed.</p>

<p>‘I suppose they all wear buttons like this?’
she said, producing the uncouth ornament
from her neck.</p>

<p>‘Yes, one middy’s button’s like another
middy’s button, you know; that’s the worst
of it,’ said the Captain; ‘and it’s just the
same with their dirks and their heads of
hair. They seem to turn all the young dogs
out of one mould. I think they ought to be
stamped for identification.’</p>

<p>Victoria withdrew into the shade of the
room.</p>

<p>The next morning was the last morning;
yet who would have guessed it? It began
just as the others had begun, with early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">(118)</span>
wanderings on the breezy hills, with laughter,
with the giving and taking of tokens. It went
on like the other mornings, only now the ship
had landed the last of our simple stores, and
her boat was waiting to take her people off.
She was to fire a Royal Salute, as she left us,
by particular request, and to hoist the Royal
Standard, and man the yards. The girls seemed
merrier than ever at the prospect of it. The
Captain, at the head of his officers, stood at the
landing-stage; the Ancient faced him, with his
smiling subjects in the rear. There was but
one more ceremony, and it was accomplished
when the two grasped hands, as the boat, now
freighted with our departing guests, with one
strong shove, left the shores of the Island.</p>

<p>Then, for a truth, the womankind seemed
to feel that it was parting, and a cry went up
from them as blood-curdling as a cry of
‘Murder!’ heard in the night. It was the
fatal gift of intensity in extremes common to
these southern natures. The place of gladness
was, in a moment, turned into the place of
grief; they threw themselves on the ground,
and bit their dishevelled hair; they stretched
supplicating hands towards the boat. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">(119)</span>
was a tropic storm of woe. Never had I
seen such utter abandonment of the very hope
of hope. It made one sick to think of the
pain there is in the world—the pain that clings
like a shadow to every joy, and that sets its
seal on every decisive fact of being, from
birth to death, on the going out, equally with
the coming in, as though to forbid all false
comfort in the belief of mere alternation. For
alternation there is not; with a wail begins
the dismal account of human experience, and
with a groan it ends, whatever may come
between. Poor wretches! bloated out of all
beauty with the water of their tears, I could
have killed them as they grovelled there, for
very rage of pity. Anything to stop these
dreary sequences of sorrow. The three days
of beatitude are past; and, for the promise
of all the coming years, listen to the Ancient
as he turns away:</p>

<span class="title">A MISSION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">A deep melancholy, an extreme lassitude
follow our great bereavement. ’Tis as though
Death had passed over us, and his lingering
shadow still blighted the sunlight of the Isle.
We turned to work again, but, at first, only
like automaton figures. There is the action
of labour, but little effect. We eat and drink
in much the same mechanical way. A bird’s-eye
view of us would suggest something in waxwork
on a grand scale. Our talk is depressing
as a demonstration on the phonograph, the
topics indifferent, the tones a mere resurrection
of the voice. No one speaks of the ship that
is dead and gone.</p>

<p>Victoria, whose personal share in the
common sorrow can be but small, seems to
grieve as much as any of us. I am not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">(121)</span>
allowed to be with her now—rather I see she
does not want me, and I keep away. When
she starts for the Peak, I start for the Watcher’s
Cave, and we pine on opposite heights. Her
simple household duties done, she will disappear
for the whole day. I pass a good deal
of time in the Ancient’s library, reading
yellow British classics, out of the old scuttled
ship. They are interleaved with book-marks,
each a delicate feminine finger beckoning to
a place of refreshment and rest. It is a
question of time and season, and perhaps
Victoria herself will tell me when to speak.</p>

<p>But I tire of waiting at last, the sooner
because, till now, she has shared all her
thoughts with me; and, one day, I track her
to a silent shelter of woods south of the ridge.
She lies in the high grass, picking a flower
to pieces, but otherwise quite still.</p>

<p>‘Victoria.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! thinking of you has brought you,’
she says, turning her head with no surprise.</p>

<p>‘How could I know you wanted me?’</p>

<p>‘I did not know it myself till to-day.’</p>

<p>‘Why must <em>you</em> suffer, Victoria?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">(122)</span></p>

<p>‘I do not suffer at all as you think; but
they do; anyone can see that.’</p>

<p>‘Well, that is their concern, or, at most,
your father’s. You are not Governor of the
Island.’</p>

<p>‘I am the Governor’s daughter,’ she said,
in another tone. ‘And what can my father
do? What can anyone do, but you, perhaps?
You must help us. Only you <em>can</em> help us.
We are a poor lost people, without you.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘This sorrow——’</p>

<p>‘Will pass in a week. Let it run its
course.’</p>

<p>‘I do not want it to pass like that, to die
of mere numbness. So much else will die
along with it, if it does.’</p>

<p>‘Fight it down.’</p>

<p>‘No, no, no! What a bludgeon man you
are! You must be killing something. And
you can’t kill a sorrow or a weakness by what
you call fighting it. Perhaps it will kill you
instead. I know; do you think I have never
had to try? Now listen to what I say.
Whenever you are weak, or whenever you
are bad, you are not to go into battle with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">(123)</span>
your own heart and twang off little texts at
it. Heart will put on its casing, and turn the
points of the texts; or, perhaps, twang back
at you, and you will both be wounded and
worried, that’s all. And, if you win, you
have either a corpse before you, or a slave,
and there’s a nice union till death do us
part!’</p>

<p>‘You are to run away, perhaps. Is that
your woman’s science of war?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, now we have heard the mocking
bird on the Island!’ she said, in grave rebuke.
‘But that is just it; you are to run away, but
always to higher ground. Leave your weakness
and your badness alone, and try for goodness,
that is all. Don’t waste yourself in the
marshes; the mountain is the best place. An
old man who had lived in India with the
priests told me that, and I gave him some
yams for it. He was cook to a whaler. Yet
you say we don’t know how to trade.’</p>

<p>‘But what has all this to do with my
healing powers? That is what puzzles me.’</p>

<p>‘Lead us to the higher ground,’ she said,
laying her hand on my arm.</p>

<p>‘What <em>do</em> you mean?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">(124)</span></p>

<p>‘Civilise us. Make us like England. Give
us larger things to live for. Tell us what we
must do. There must be something wanting,
but I cannot tell what it is. It all seems so
beautiful here—the shining sun, friends to
love, peace, the singing, the sea, the very
wind in this wood! Yet I know there must
be something. That is why the Queen’s ships
never come again. We are like children,
perhaps.’</p>

<p>‘Keep so.’</p>

<p>‘No, no, we want to be like you. This
is babyland. Make us great and good. You
know the secret: you have lived <em>there</em>.’</p>

<p>‘What am I to do?’</p>

<p>‘Speak to father. Father will speak to
the people. He does not see it as I do, but you
can open his eyes. Then we’ll have a meeting,
and begin to be like England at once.’</p>

<p>It was inviting, no doubt: to be a Moses
of the Pacific, and to shape a nation! Perhaps
they <em>are</em> in a bad way, if one comes to think
of it. I remember that test case of the barter
of the yams. It seemed nothing in passing;
it is everything, if you look at it in the proper
light. What poverty of spirit! they cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">(125)</span>
so much as dispose of a vegetable on first
principles. They have no principles at all,
only beautiful emotions; no science of life;
at best, but an unconscious art. Upon my
word, they live like so many lilies of the
field, not even like orchids, which, in a general
way, are at least brought up. They are a
mere flowery mead of humanity. By the
time I have brought them to this state, in
swift meditation, I myself might be a Scotch
landscape gardener, for my yearning to lay
them out in walks.</p>

<p>‘Very well, Victoria; anything to make
you happy—you and yours. You wish to
have your people civilised?’</p>

<p>Her smile was answer enough.</p>

<p>‘I must warn you beforehand: it hurts.’</p>

<p>‘How else could we expect it to do us
good?’</p>

<p>‘Sometimes you will think me your worst
enemy.’</p>

<p>‘O! be still! when will you speak to
father?’</p>

<p>‘To-night. But you must take care to
keep us to ourselves—us three. We want no
outsiders.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">(126)</span></p>

<p>‘I will take care.’</p>

<p>‘Now go, dear child, and leave me alone
to work it out.’</p>

<p>She had gradually lowered her voice, as
though to lull me to rest in a blessed promise
and a blessed resolve. Now she ceased speaking
altogether, and only looked ineffable
gratitude and hope, as she stole away softly
through the long grass.</p>

</div>


<p class="noindent">No better opportunity could have been desired.
His Excellency was very chatty that night, in
mere reaction of mood, perhaps, against the
prevailing gloom of the Island. We met on
the lawn; and he was as full of glowing
courtesies, before passing indoors to his
supper, as the gracious Duncan on another
occasion, while he ran the same risk of
deadly intent against the peace that was his
very life. I, knowing what was making ready
for him, could not but feel like a Thane
of Cawdor, while Victoria, I am sorry to say,
filled the part of the lady of the castle. She
watched me, even more than she watched
him, and whenever I showed symptoms of
recoil from the dreadful venture, she impelled
me by a look.</p>

<p>‘We’re getting better, sir,’ he said cheerily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">(128)</span>
when he had finished his meal, ‘but it’s a slow
cure. I’m going to fine some of ’em to-morrow
for cutting the trees. It’ll wake ’em
up, and give ’em something else to think about.
Not but what things might have been worse;
only three new love-knots, according to my
reckoning, four initials with crown and
anchor, two hearts with arrows, one ditto
without—and I think I’ve been all over the
place.’</p>

<p>Now for it.</p>

<p>‘What else can you expect, my friend?
They must do something. Things are rather
slow here.’</p>

<p>It was the horrid first blow, and it quite
staggered the poor old man.</p>

<p>‘As how?’ he faintly said.</p>

<p>I could have stopped for pity, but Victoria
smiled at me from behind his chair. Then, I
shut my eyes and struck on.</p>

<p>‘Rather humdrum, you know. No spirit,
no careers; one man as good as another, and
not even a good deal better, as the saying
goes.’</p>

<p>‘It never troubled me,’ he meekly said.</p>

<p>‘Yet you are the Chief Magistrate!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">(129)</span></p>

<p>‘Well, if we are in fault, sir, I shall be
glad to hear of it. What’s amiss?’</p>

<p>‘Not very much, perhaps; only I think
you want variety of formation, that’s all.’</p>

<p>‘We shall get it right, sir, I dare say, if
it is to be got right. Please go on. You
have travelled; you are able to speak.’</p>

<p>‘Well, by variety of formation I mean the
division of classes. Look at the beautiful
gradation at home—an aristocracy for the
fine art of life; a middle class for the moral
qualities, which are not fine art, but only
helps to it; a lower for the mere drudgery
outside of both art and morals. The great
mark of all progressive nations is that struggle
of each man to make some other do his dirty
work for him, which is commonly known as
aspiration for the higher life. A few live in
dignity, unhaste, affluence, and wear the fine
flower of manners; but, to sustain the costly
show, and help them so to live, the many
give up all hope of these things on their own
account, sometimes forming perfect castes,
who do the dirty work from father to son, as
others fill the office of Earl Marshal.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">(130)</span></p>

<p>‘I do assure you, sir, we’ve nothing of
that sort here.’</p>

<p>‘This self-denying section has many names.
Sometimes it is called the slave class; but
“working,” or “lower” class, or “sons of
toil,” is usually preferred, as being the politer
and less descriptive term. They engage in
all the mal-odorous tasks, to the end that
the others may smell sweet, and accumulate
porcelain, where the conception of beautiful
living is in that somewhat rudimentary stage.
Now you are in a curious, not to say an unexampled,
position. You are without this
indispensable class; and how you have got on,
even so far, without it is a mystery to me.
Being without it, you are, of course, without
the other two. Your middle term of the great
combination is nowhere; and, for your aristocracy,
where is it to be found? You may
have your own way of bettering yourselves,
but what it is I fail to see.’</p>

<p>‘Of bettering ourselves by making others
worse?’</p>

<p>‘Well—if you choose to put it in that
way. Inequality is our religion, as a great
man has so finely said. Our humblest grocer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">(131)</span>
likes, in his way, to have an eldest son, and
even sometimes, in modest imitation of his
superiors, a youngest daughter.’</p>

<p>‘We can’t alter it,’ he said, fumbling
in his pocket; ‘it ain’t allowed under the
rules.’</p>

<p>‘A new law?’ I suggested—‘a sort of constitutional
amendment?’</p>

<p>‘They wouldn’t stand it; that’s my humble
belief.’</p>

<p>‘They might be made to stand it,’ I
said darkly.</p>

<p>‘Who’s to make ’em?’ asked the Chief
Magistrate.</p>

<p>‘Hum!’</p>

<p>But his Excellency said nothing to help
me out.</p>

<p>‘You’ve no one you could rely upon, I
suppose, if you thought it necessary to save
society—no band of patriots devoted to your
person—no arms?’</p>

<p>‘There’s the public hammer; that’s all I
know of.’</p>

<p>‘Well, well; turn it over in your mind.
See what we have done at home. A few centuries
ago we were no better off than you;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">(132)</span>
every man with his bit of land for tillage, his
common for grazing, a rather demoralising
plenty in every hut—no really efficient slave
class, in fact. But a patriotic nobility soon
put a stop to that, enclosed the commons,
broke up the small farms, and made a proletariat
that is, to this day, the wonder and
envy of the world. Then began industrial
and imperial England. The old state was
England for the English; but really they did
not know what to do with it; the new one is,
England for her betters—and see where we
are now.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! it is wonderful how you manage
things over there; it’s like a piece of watchmaking.
But, bless you, our fingers are too
clumsy.’</p>

<p>‘You have to master the principle of the
movement—that is all. Teach a whole community
to unite riches with righteousness as the
object of its hunger and thirst; and the thirst,
especially, will beget a tremulous cerebral excitement
which will keep it always on the go.
Do not carry this to excess, for it will never
do to have your social movement confounded
with the drinker’s “jumps.” Only remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">(133)</span>
that, as we argue, no wealth—no luxury;
no luxury—no crumbs for Lazarus.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, dear!’ said Victoria.</p>

<p>‘Oh, deary, deary me!’ said the Ancient,
wiping his brow.</p>

<p>‘You yourself might set an example in this
matter. Such things often grow from very
small beginnings. The Island diet, I perceive,
is chiefly fish and vegetables. Now, in your
position as Governor, you should eat meat
at least three times a week. It would mark
a difference; and, by-and-by, you might
manage to get the more toothsome things,
such as the sweetbreads and the guavas,
reserved for your own table. The great principle
is, not—as, I fear, you imagine—that one
man’s best of service ought to count like
another man’s best, in respect of his right to
the needful things of life, but that, on the
contrary, each bit of human helpfulness should
be weighed in a balance, and more pudding
given to those whose morsel weighs most.
The nice adjustment of the quantity of the
pudding to the nature of the service is our
economic and, indeed, our moral ideal. We
have long since given the requisite superfluity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">(134)</span>
to our governors and other men of action;
now the cry is, “More pudding to the seers;”
and it is one of the most exhilarating cries of
the day, in its evidence of our progress in true
spirituality. A great preacher, a great penman,
a great revealer of the beautiful in
plastic art, soon has his plate heaped up.’</p>

<p>‘But won’t the others get less?’ said Victoria,
now beginning, I thought, to repent of
her part in the plot.</p>

<p>‘O yes; but the others are stupid.’</p>

<p>‘They are brothers.’</p>

<p>‘Only by courtesy, I think you will find.
“Brothers in Christ Jesus,” I believe, is the
exact term.’</p>

<p>‘They get hungry three times a day, all
the same,’ said the girl, flashing revolt.</p>

<p>‘I am afraid you will begin to think
I want to civilise you against your will,’
I returned, after a pause.—The rising was
quelled.</p>

<p>‘Then, excuse the remark, my friend, but
your Church puzzles me a little. I see no
hierarchy, to use the proper expression; no
grade upon grade, each, as aforesaid, enjoying
more pudding than the one below, until, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">(135)</span>
the highest, we reach a tableland covered
with acres of this delicacy. To tell the honest
truth about it, the Church began in a very
small way, and it will not do to ignore the fact
that the old stable has become a prosperous
house of business, with a frontage in the best
thoroughfares. Some of the Apostles, respectable
as they undoubtedly were, must
have smelt strongly of fish—though modern
research has, I believe, discovered that
they were not mere hands before the mast,
but owners of smacks. Their successors—this
Bishop from York or Canterbury, this
Cardinal Prince from Rome—never offend in
that way. Their lives testify to their faith
in a manner that must carry conviction to
the most sceptical minds. They do not merely
say that religion is a good thing, and an all-sufficient,
for this world and the next; they
show it forth. Step into their houses—hangings
and raiment of price, cabinets of
medals, rarest parchments, bindings, curios,
gems of painting, six courses and dessert every
day but fast-day, and kickshaws innumerable
to make a mere gastronomic symbol even of
that. Their very pastoral staves are wrought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">(136)</span>
in fine gold; and, to preclude all possibility
of their employment in coarser uses, are so
adroitly filled in with ornament that, by no
exercise of human ingenuity, could they be
made to hook so much as a leg of lamb. Thus
has a religion of humility been saved from its
earlier accidental association with low life, and
become a calling fit for a gentleman, until the
middle, and even the upper, classes have not
disdained it, nor professional investors of
talent considered it unworthy of their regard.
All its original difficulties as a creed of morbid
self-denial have been cleared away by the
beautiful modern development of the symbol.
Is it awkward to watch and work for the
needy, day and night? Well, wash their feet
at Easter, and you may wash your hands of
them for the rest of the year. In my travels
have I seen an Emperor and an Archbishop
condescending to this exercise, one quite busy
with the scented water, the other at hand with
the <i lang="fr">serviette</i> of fine linen edged with lace.
’Tis a peppercorn rent of service and of compassionate
deeds; and for this, what generous
holdings in the good things of life, in park,
moorland, and forest, in palaces of splendour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">(137)</span>
that open to no wayfarer without an introduction,
yet are often symbolled for boundless
hospitality by some pretty device! The
symbol! the symbol! precious contrivance
for effecting a true <i lang="la">modus vivendi</i> between the
tastes of a gentleman and the duties of a creed.
With this to aid, my friend, your Church will
be the fitting mainstay of your social arrangements,
being indeed truly of them, bone of
bone, flesh of flesh, its meanest curate fired
with the laudable ambition of getting on in
the world, and, to this end, not regardless of
snug spinsters with the talent laid by in the
napkin of the Three per Cents. But where are
<em>you</em> in all this? I ask, Where is even your
beginning of better things? What note have
you of a living Church, when you have not so
much as a great doctrinal contest to settle the
metaphysical reasons for goodness, before you
begin to be good?’</p>

<p>‘That’s what I was just thinking,’ said the
Ancient; ‘whereabouts are we?’</p>

<p>‘Parties are the life of the Church: is
there no way of starting a question? Do you
do anything in pew rents?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ he said, ‘there’s my place a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">(138)</span>
nearer the schoolmaster than the others, but
that’s only because I’m rather deaf.’</p>

<p>‘Vestments? You could not put your
pastor in bands? The great thing is to mark
him off from the rest, and to give him his
badge, as a being engaged in special communication
with the Unseen. He is not to be like
yourselves, a simple work-a-day creature,
feeling his way to the law by the perpetual
revelations of the conscience and the heart,
and only getting a little beyond you in the
knowledge of it, because he feels and labours
more. No, he is to be a creature apart, interpreting
a message from behind the Veil—a
message delivered, not merely a meaning
found. This solemn function must have its
uniform; so we think; and, for some time, a
quarrel over the cut of the uniform was one
of the most stimulating exercises of our faith.’</p>

<p>‘Quarrels are fines with us,’ said his
Excellency, ‘but we might strike that out.’</p>

<p>‘I do not see what father is to do in all
this,’ said Victoria.</p>

<p>‘Then I am afraid I have failed to make
my meaning clear. He might do everything;
he might become the father of his country by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">(139)</span>
sowing the seeds of a governing caste. Your
worst danger, at present, is the want of all
distinction in externals between governors
and governed. I have already suggested a
slight improvement in the matter of domestic
style. There are others. Your father dwells
in the same sort of hut as his people—why
not raise the roof of the hut? Six inches
would do it. He is altogether too easy of
approach. Is there no one who could act
as chamberlain, usher, or go-between?’</p>

<p>‘Reuben hasn’t got much to do of evenings,’
said the Ancient, in a musing tone that seemed
to betoken no displeasure.</p>

<p>‘That’s it; live like yourself, and take
your place; guide your people; rouse them
out of this sloth of comfort and happiness;
give them national ideals, great ambitions,
great struggles.’</p>

<p>He shook his head. ‘I really don’t think
you could get up a fight about anything
here.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t mean that exactly; but why not
have a foreign policy, and then it would all
come in the way of nature? Have you no
neighbours?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">(140)</span></p>

<p>‘None.’</p>

<p>‘There’s that Island Reuben found out,
father,’ said Victoria.</p>

<p>‘Why not place it under your protectorate?’</p>

<p>‘There’s nothing to protect, only some
dead coral and a cave full of bones. Besides,
it’s a hundred and fifty miles away.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, my good friend, your motto should
be “distance no object,” if you want to get on.
But is there nothing nearer?’</p>

<p>‘Well, there is another—only eighty miles
off; but that’s worse—dead coral without the
bones.’</p>

<p>‘You are certainly unfortunate. But I
should protect these places, all the same, and
leave a garrison. Never tell me! if you push
on far enough, you must come to something
to fight at last. Providence can hardly have
meant you to be shut up in this place without
an enemy in the world. Only take care,
when you do come within touch of your fellow
creatures, to have a weapon in your hand.’</p>

<p>The girl shuddered.—‘More killing!’</p>

<p>‘You’ve got to find your excuse for hitting
’em, even then,’ he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">(141)</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, insist on protecting them, and that
will do.’</p>

<p>‘But how are you to find an excuse for
that?’</p>

<p>‘Why you seize one place to-day, to make
good your hold on another that you seized
yesterday; and to-morrow you seize one place
more, for the same reason. It is a process
known as “inevitable expansion”; and if only
you follow it out logically, it leads you all
round the world.’</p>

<p>‘But where’s the good?’</p>

<p>‘It employs your young men and your
bolder spirits; it doubles the wealth and the
luxury of your capitalists; it leaves even a
few more crusts from their table for your
poor; and it provides a receptacle for your
overflow of destitution when the crusts give
out. In earlier days, when this system of
main drainage on the colonial system was
almost unknown, Nature had periodically to
step in with a Black Death or a Plague to
clear the heaps of human refuse away.’</p>

<p>‘It seems rather a roundabout way, after
all. Why not try to make ’em happy at
home?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">(142)</span></p>

<p>‘Well, my friend, you cannot argue about
these things, you must feel them. Civilisation
is an acquired taste. Take your time, and
let me know how you like the flavour, to-morrow
night.’</p>

<p>Neither returned my parting salutation.
The Ancient was lost in thought, and did not
hear it: Victoria had stolen out to gossip
with the stars.</p>

<span class="title">REPENTANCE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">I found her next morning seated on the
Peak, and looking out to sea. She turned at
my approach, as I came up the steep path
from the market-place.</p>

<p>‘That is where the fighting is to begin,
then,’ she said, pointing north and north-east
into the infinite blue. ‘We are to go there
and look for something to kill—you said so.
Father says you did not; I say you did. Oh,
why must they always begin these things by
killing something? Is there no new way?’</p>

<p>‘Only just a little killing, Victoria; it will
soon be over; and only aborigines to kill! I
believe they hardly mind it at all. It would
make you a people in no time; you have no
idea how soon it would change the look of
everything here.’</p>

<p>She stood up and turning landwards, cast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">(144)</span>
a wistful gaze over the settlement. ‘I suppose
it <em>would</em> change things a good deal.’</p>

<p>‘You really would not know the place
again.’</p>

<p>‘And yet——’</p>

<p>‘Come, Victoria, look on the bright side,
and don’t go back on yourself. Where shall
we put your father’s palace? He will want
a palace, or a castle, or something of the
sort, in time. He cannot always live with
Thomas and Richard and the other one, down
there. Suppose we put him on the other
Point, facing this. Then we will build a
little arbour here for you, and rail it off, and
you shall have it all to yourself.’</p>

<p>She answered never a word, but soon I
wanted no one to answer, for the excitement
of laying out this domain for the higher civilisation
was enough in itself. ‘We will keep
all this northern half of the Island for the
governing classes, and put the people on the
other. The views are so much prettier on
our side. If you could persuade your good
folk to give up the settlement altogether, it
would make a sweet little park for the castle;
and the market-place, below, might easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">(145)</span>
be rigged up as a preserve. I should put a
factory on the popular section. It would amuse
them. The chimney need never show, if you
know how to choose your site.’</p>

<p>‘What is a factory?’ asked Victoria.</p>

<p>‘What is a factory? Well, a factory is—a
factory. Dear me, fair Islander, you are
sometimes too elementary for profitable talk!
A factory is a place where a number of people
work together to simplify the process of
appropriating their earnings to one. You
give them a little of it back, for provender,
and keep as much as you can for yourself.
What you keep back is called capital. They
make it all, of course, or some of their forerunners
made it, every sou or cent. You get
it—that is the main point. Your share is
claimed as cost of superintendence, charge
for the loan of your brains, or, by-and-by,
as interest on your savings—a very
superior plea. But it all comes out of labour—all,
all, <strong>ALL</strong>. Labour does not mind, poor
thing, if you give it just enough to go on
with. According to the best authorities,
there must be, at least, one meal a day. The
half-meal experiment is discredited: it cuts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">(146)</span>
things too fine. This is the starting-point—just
what will keep people alive. How
much more they will insist on having is a
matter of bargain between you and them.
But only fight hard against their greediness,
and it is astonishing how you can keep it
down.’</p>

<p>‘But why do you want to keep it down,
and take so much for yourself?’</p>

<p>‘For the use of your precious brains, for
direction, for vigilance, for keeping your eye
on ’em. Think how they would idle, else!
There’s a good deal of idling in this settlement.
I caught two the other day—supposed
to be hoeing potatoes—really pelting each
other with wild flowers. It was in the great
dip of green turf and shrubbery, just beyond
the gorge. And now I think of it, why not
put the factory there—on the slope; so that
all you will have to do with your refuse is
to shoot it out at the back door? It will
take years to fill up the hollow, and when it
is filled up, there are others just as good, to
right and left. That is the way they make
the valleys useful in Lancashire; I have
seen it done. The people can have their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">(147)</span>
little cottages on the edge; and, as the
rubbish hardens, it makes a handy playground
for the children, right under the
mother’s eye. Keep your eye on ’em all
round, from the cradle to the grave—that’s
the essence of the system. So, there is your
factory, Victoria, and now what are you going
to manufacture? Tappa cloth! Turn it
out cheap, and run it as a new kind of
shoddy? Potatoes! Potato spirit! How did
that man make his tipple—the fellow that
went mad, and jumped off the steep place?
Import machinery, and get the whiskey
monopoly of the South Seas? Sugar! Are
we quite in the right place for that? Taro!
Why, of course:—“Taro, the new Vegetable
Food! Testimonial from his Excellency the
Governor of Pitcairn.” How do you like that
for a poster? Birds, beasts, and fishes—what
can you do in that way? Sea birds!
If we could get up something for ladies’ hats,
your father might be a rich man in ten years.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, bother!’ said she.</p>

<p>‘I need hardly remind you, Victoria, that
this is not the language of economical discussion.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">(148)</span></p>

<p>‘Well, I cannot help it; you seem so fond
of beginning at the wrong end.’</p>

<p>‘Excuse me, that is just what I was going
to say about your people here. It is all the
fault of their unhappy geographical situation.
Quite upside down, you know. I could show
you in an instant, if I had a map.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I know, but I sometimes wonder
which <em>is</em> the right side up. All your plans
seem to begin by taking something for yourself,
everlasting No. 1; “take, take, take,”
and so your world goes round. I wonder if it
would not go round as well to “give, give,
give.” Think of others first; self is sure to get
its turn. How would that be, I wonder? I
do so wonder sometimes! Do the hardest
thing first, and get that right. I do not think
things can ever come right, unless you begin
by giving up. Don’t you think it is just as
disgusting to make as much as you honestly
can, as to eat as much as you honestly can?
Why do you want to stuff so? That is what
I thought you meant yesterday. And you did
mean it; you may say what you like. Suppose
you are cleverer than the others; well,
be thankful you can do something more for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">(149)</span>
them. That seems the natural way. Are
you sure you haven’t got a twist? I only ask.
Why should brains be so greedy? All the
harm in the world that I ever saw or heard of
comes from greediness, gobbling. Give up,
give up, give up. Oh, only that makes men
different from pasturing brutes! Once I read
a natural history book, and the gentleman that
wrote it was trying to find out what made a
man a man. The two legs wouldn’t do, you
know, because there’s the chickens. Then
he tried “no tails?”—“no feathers?” Oh,
how he did try, taking off this and that, till the
thing seemed almost ready to put in the oven.
He made me laugh so. I came up here, and
thought about it, just like a riddle; and at last
I said, “give it up;” and then it came upon
me, all of a sudden—why that was the very
answer! That is why man is not the same as
the pasturing brutes: because he can give up,
because he can think of all, and himself as
only one of them. He is real man when he is
doing that, and real brute when he is doing
the other thing. That is what I thought you
were going to tell us last night—how much
more we could give up. Do show us how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">(150)</span>
they give up in England; that’s what we want
to know.’</p>

<p>‘Victoria, don’t be troublesome. I am
planning the estate.’</p>

<p>I turned and looked down upon the Island,
north, south, and west, in all its heavenly
beauty; ah, what a dish to carve! Blue sea,
patches of coral sand, silver cascades gushing
from the rocks; glory of trees and flowers, of
clear skies, and of rainbow-tinted mists, flecking
here and there the background of perfect
turquoise; glory of the soft beauty of the
grove and settlement, of the wild beauty of
the hills, of the ordered beauty of the happy
mean in the plantations beyond, all visible,
from this height, to the farthest rocks that
stood firm for ever against the beat of
the waves. The delight of it came up to
me through every sense; in its odours, from
the groves and gardens, the soft breeze sighing
my way; in its sounds, from the tinkle of
a tame goat’s bell here and there, or from the
faint echoes of the woodman’s axe, following,
in due measure of seconds, after the flash of the
sunlight on the polished steel. And, for sight
again, there was more of the exquisite human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">(151)</span>
life in tiny groups dotted all over the fields in
leisured toil, or in opalescent green shapes
in the water, off the far Point, that I knew to
be the bodies of diving girls.</p>

<p>Then, for the inner eye, the scene changed,
and I was once more on the steps of the
Royal Exchange, with that other sight below
me wrestling its way out of the London mist—the
Blessed of Dividend day; the dandy
clerks making for the turtle; the shabby
clerks making for the buns; the parson hurrying
away to his preaching, as per bequest of
pious founder; the hungry-looking wretches
peddling the pocket combs; the flower girls
in their foul finery, mal-odorous of gin all this
way off, types of that fatallest of all divisions
of labour which puts the work in absolute
non-relation to the life of the worker; the
slouching beggar; the shunting policeman; the
demonstrating rabble with the average 7<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr>
to the hundred pockets, divided by a wall
only from the bullion wells of the Bank; the
nondescript thousands in black, and brown,
and russet, and all, all, as explained, from
the beggar upwards, tormented with the
secret itch of civilisation, all scratching on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">(152)</span>
the sly, and, with the scratching, throwing
themselves everlastingly out of focus for my
grand pictorial composition of a happy family
of human kind.</p>

<p>And, as the grim pageant faded out again,
I was once more back in the Blessed Isle—the
Isle that I was laying out afresh for
civilisation, to make it like the isle of my
birth. I looked again, and hardly a point
had changed in my short excursion to the
other side of the world. The axe that was
poised in the air was now buried in the tree,
and the shining body of one of the girls had
come to the surface, to catch the sunlight in
its stead. Victoria was looking too, but with
her head turned from mine; and, as we
travelled in opposite directions round the
circle of vision, our eyes had to meet at last.</p>

<p>I read in hers what she, I know, must
have read in mine: ‘Oh, the pity of it!’</p>

<p>And, with this pang, came a strange question.
As that scene was the beginning of the
disease that drove me so far afield for ease
from torment, is not this scene the beginning
of the remedy? For, what may be the meaning
of that troubled vision of the Exchange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">(153)</span>
steps, what but ‘Each for himself,’ and the
Devil ever on the track of the hindmost, till
there is but one left for first and last? While,
of this vision, the ever blessed interpretation is
clear and true—‘Each for all’ in love, and
truth, and mutual helpfulness, in real brotherhood
and sisterhood—the core of the whole
mystery, in morals, politics, religion, law and
life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br>
<span class="title">A DECLARATION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">‘When are we to begin the alterations?’ said
the girl.</p>

<p>‘Not yet, my Victoria! No, not yet! Let
all things stay as they are, and let me stay
with them, here by your side. Beautiful, perfect
creature! Let me speak what must be
spoken: I love you!’</p>

<p>A moment before I had no thought that
these words would ever pass my lips. They
were almost as much of a shock to me as to
the girl. It had been my secret; or shall I
say that it was almost a secret to me? Exquisite
charm! In my calmer moments, I
should have hated the thought of ever tearing
this tender veil of mystery and reserve,
behind which all that is sweetest in emotion
dwells. To be able to love her as at first one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">(155)</span>
loves the light, without analysis, was the most
stimulating of joys; to have it all set down in
quantitative inventory of vows, and bonds, and
declarations, might be quite another thing.
Now, my heart was naked to her gaze, and I
stood silent with a sort of shame.</p>

<p>She, too, was silent. She had taken her
hand from mine, and clasped it in the other,
behind her, just as on the day of our first
meeting; and there she stood, erect, contemplative,
almost on the same spot. The feet
were drawn together, the head was thrown
back; it was her characteristic attitude for
emergencies. So had I seen her first, the
beautiful piece of life, the divine animal, flawless
in health and strength and freshness
as a Venus of the Louvre, yet all touched
with spiritual loveliness by the great eyes—fierce
now, as I feared—and by the heaving
breast.</p>

<p>‘I cannot help it,’ I said, with a sort of
sullen passion. ‘I felt so sure that I could
keep this thing back that I set no guard
over myself. Since it is out, take the truth.
Whatever comes of it, we can never be the
same to each other again.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">(156)</span></p>

<p>‘We must be the same,’ she said, with <span class="cor" title="Source: al" id="cor156">all</span>
the deep liquid softness in her voice, that was
missing from her gaze. ‘Oh! I knew this
would come one day, I knew it would. And
I did nothing to prevent it. The fault is all
mine.’</p>

<p>‘The fault?’</p>

<p>‘I am the wretchedest woman that ever
lived,’ sobbed Victoria, suddenly sinking to
the ground in a passion of tears, and beating
it, in the wild despairing way of her sister-savages,
when the boat took their sweethearts
away—statue no longer, but very flesh and
blood in every quivering nerve.</p>

<p>I did not try to raise her, I did not stir.
In a few moments, when the paroxysm had
passed, she raised herself, and then came, in
the tenderest way, and took my hand, and
looked straight into my eyes, this time, through
the blessed dews that dimmed her own.</p>

<p>‘You must know it. Some one else loves
me. The word has been spoken. I am
promised. Come with me—but never tell a
living soul! Then, I should die.’</p>

<p>She led me swiftly to a small grove of wild
trees, nestling in a dip of the rock, and thin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">(157)</span>
and poor, for they saw neither the eastern nor
the western sun. And, plunging into it, her
hand still holding mine, then climbing again,
after the sharp descent, she stopped before a
dwarf-tree, where the Ancient would never
have thought of looking for any infraction of
his forest laws. A rude monogram was carved
on the tree, with a date and two crosses.</p>

<p>‘We cut them together on our last day,’ said
the girl, laying her finger on one of the crosses,
‘and this was mine. This was cut from his
coat the same day,’ and she drew the wretched
old navy-button from its nest in her pure
bosom. ‘Now you know all. I am promised;
and if I forget it, how can I ever say my
prayers again?’</p>

<p>The monogram was V.A., and the A., I
suppose, was the baptismal initial of the
mysterious Curly, who won the great battle
with the slave-dhow, and whose laugh and
smile divided the honours of admiration with
mankind. Victoria’s poor secret was hardly
worth the telling, for, of course, I had
guessed it long before. But what I had not
guessed was this fidelity of daily, hourly remembrance
to the vanished hero of a vanished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">(158)</span>
ship—now, perhaps, firing her guns of joyous
salutation in some haven on the other side of
the world.</p>

<p>Did I hint this to the beautiful devotee?
Not I! One moment of temptation came, but
it passed; and I was spared the meanness of
tormenting her with a doubt. Since Curly
was her religion, let him be her religion still.
Here was his shrine. It was hung all about
with strange little memorials of him that looked
like aids to worship, votive offerings of bits of
ribbon on the branches of his sacred tree. A
necklace of shells, fastened in its place with
pins, formed a border in alto-relievo for the
monogram and the date. In due course, no
doubt, there would be an altar for the navy-button
and a temple for the altar—so such
things grow. I remembered what the girl
had told me of the old strain of idolatry in
her blood. Yet truth and love are so entrancing
to the gaze that, in regarding them,
the real amateur soon loses all thought of self.
The picture in this virgin’s soul was a master-piece,
not to be marred by a touch—Curly in
his orisons, ever praying with his face towards
the Isle; seas and continents between them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">(159)</span>
yet the electric thread of sympathy only the
longer on that account.</p>

<p>All this I fancied forth, and, as usual, in
that kind of snap-shooting at truth, I could
not be quite sure of my mark. With all her
hope and trust in Curly, Victoria seemed full
of a strange disquiet about him, not easy to
explain.</p>

<p>‘Five ships here since he left,’ she said,
‘and no word or token from him—not so much
as one of these,’ and she returned the button
to her breast. ‘The black people have killed
him, perhaps. Every night and every morning
this last month I have come here to ask for a
sign of him, living or dead. You remember
that night I saw the shape on the Ridge: I
half fancied—that was why I was so afraid;
just because I was with you. Have I done
anything wrong? Have I done wrong?
Nobody helps me. I seem to stand all alone.’</p>

<p>‘Victoria, if you talk like that, I must tell
you that I am by your side.’</p>

<p>‘Dear, good friend, yes, I seem to be
forgetting you. Why is it so hard to do
right? Why is our choice always between
pain and pain?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">(160)</span></p>

<p>‘You shall not choose, princess; I will
choose for you. Be my comrade, and only
that. I will ask for no more. As for me,
let me be to you what I like, what is best
for me. All wisdom is in loving you, and I
want to be wise. If I must not speak to you,
let me spend precious hours by your side,
looking, learning, for your eyes light for me
the dark places of the world.’</p>

<p>‘Comrades then,’ she said, smiling; and
she gave me her hand.</p>

<span class="title">A MEDITATION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">So now, I think, I begin to see why I have
been sent here—not to give lessons, but to
take them. My education has been neglected,
and I am coaching for a pass in the higher
learning of life. I am reading with Victoria—reading
in the deep eyes, without book. It is
a course of social economy by a new method.
The method is to look on this image of
the Divine, as intently as may be without
being caught in the act. I must not be
caught; half of the gusty anger of the gods
with adoring mortals comes of their dislike
of being stared at. And, besides looking,
there must be listening—listening with the
heart. The ear will not do; the true message
of this exquisite piece of being is only
for a finer organ. Put a microphone in a
cave, and it will register the beat of the earth’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">(162)</span>
breathing: with a still more delicate instrument,
perhaps, this girl’s elemental nature, at
its stillest, will be heard to speak. As soon
as my heart was stirred, then truly she began
to be audible to me—blessed day!</p>

<p>And to give me delight, as well as profit,
she has not the faintest idea of her function.
Often I get the benefit of a whole morning’s
lecture, requiring copious notes, while, for all
she knows of it, I have but watched her as
she manœuvred a battalion of fowls.</p>

<p>A grand provision of leisure for the true
work of life seems to be her chief instinctive
aim. She has the genius of indifference to
trivial things; she is never busy with aught
that does not truly count. The idleness of
hurry is unknown to her; she is always free
for essentials—a true word, a noble action,
a great thought.</p>

<p>But this is lover’s talk. I cannot help
that; lover’s talk let it be, so only she
cannot overhear.</p>

<p>I am a true lover in this, that the things
she says to me are as nothing to the things
she seems to say. I do not want her to say
much. I can say for her all I most want to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">(163)</span>
hear. She idealises the world for me. She is
a sublime suggestion. She only starts the
game; I play. Worship is in the worshipper.
She brings out my highest, truest, best. A
something is within me; she is its mystical
correspondence in warm life. She seems to
speak things to me, she seems to be things to
me. Are these things true of her? What
care I: they are true of me!</p>

<p>So, then, for me, she is a great artist in
being. She lives to beauty, the sole end.
She does naught only for the thing done;
there is also the way of doing it. I note
her placid disdain of a certain hen, that has
an absurd habit of hatching by quantity, and
addles half the brood. The other half, for
want of due maternal care, are a species of
bush-fowl that have lost their way in civilisation,
and Victoria spends days over their bags
of bone and feathers, to bring them into
harmony with her great law. I am sure she
thinks, though she might never know how to
say it, that every problem of being is, in the
profoundest sense, a problem of manner. <em>How</em>
do you love, hate, suffer, and rejoice; nay,
how do you eat and drink? There are higher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">(164)</span>
proprieties, even in this art, than the management
of peas with the fork. Is it after the
manner of the <span class="cor" title="Source: farmyard" id="cor164">farm-yard</span>, or after the other?
I remember her little touch about the pasturing
brutes. The brutes, too, renounce,
but not as a fine art. It is only their ‘needs
must when the devil drives.’ That was her
meaning. They only do without; man <em>gives
up</em>, because man alone is the artist, and art is
choice. Living or dying, how slight as ends
in themselves! but how you live, how you
die! Is the piece well acted, or have you but
got through your part? Who wants it, merely
as a part got through? Not that greater
than Theseus, for certain, before whom this
dream-play is played.</p>

<p>That picture of the old life troubled me
so, that grand composition of the Exchange
steps. It would not come right. Here is one
whose mere presence brings everything into
its place. Let her but stand beside the easel,
and I get the key at once. Now I see where
it was wrong; now could I go among the
rushing, blurred figures of my sitters, and ask
them, for the love of God, and, still more, for
the love of man, to keep still. I could say to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">(165)</span>
them, as at her bidding, ‘Piano! piano! you
are perishing of over strain. You, the higher
up, why this frantic scraping for useless
currency? What can it do for you? How
much of peace comes out of it, how much
of fineness of life? What are you when
all is done—when you have sat at meat with
my Lord, and added the Hall in the country
to the mansion in town? Have you yet found
out the faintest inner meaning of one of the
pictures on your wall, of one of the books
on your shelf? You think Walter Map is
for monkish Latin, and that other’s vision of
“all the wealth of this world, and the woe,
both” merely for a scholar’s treat. <i lang="fr">Malheureux!</i>
rushing away to your daily drive for
more canvases, more bindings, more horses
of swiftness, more furniture, in a word, and
more dinners of the stalled ox. The greed
makes the hurry, and the wasteful idle hurry
spoils the life. Oh, the grim set of your
jaws, the thinly veiled hardness of your
eye, even at the sacred hour of rest and relaxation!
What are you but a huge river-pike
in black and white! More leisure,
friend, less lust of gear. Cut away the hindrances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">(166)</span>
to living, and begin to live. Take
nothing in but what you can digest to true
use, which is beauty of life. What a scandal,
if you were caught and opened in an unguarded
hour, and half your stomach were
found lined with vanities as profitless as the
bits of shoe leather and old corks so often
found in the maw of your prototype—vanities
of things bolted to the end of bolting, titles
of park and meadow where <em>you</em> can never find
a flower, visiting-lists where you can never
find a friend, cards for music where you may
never hear a note that breathes one of the
secrets of Heaven. Your bolting for waste
takes so much out of the common stock for
use. Your grab for superfluity baulks so
much honest craving for need!’</p>

<p>You work for it! Will no one deliver us
from the tyranny of that cry? Work for
what?—to have and to hold, to leave less and
less for the weaker, till finally, in the lowest
hell of it, the huge crowd of the uncanny have
to learn to call their base scramble for your
leavings the battle of life? More leisure for
these, from the obsession of the one degrading
thought—how to get the dry crust and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">(167)</span>
cold potato for the day’s meal. For, true living
begins only when such things are done with,
when the belly is timbered with victual, and
the back clothed, and when the spirit, that is
the all-in-all, is left free for its shaping work.
More leisure for love and friendship, and
kindly deeds, and joy—the true business,
which, if we were not blinded, would have
their banks and their depôts, and their pushing
agents in every street. The real ‘Theory of
Exchanges,’ what is it but the philosophy of
the diffusion of the humane self? Oh, the
hard world of the self-helpers, with their
Smiling apostle! oh, the hard world!—the
hard world of all the workers, high and low,
leisureless for profitable toil, the real task
hardly so much as begun—too hard even for
the very martyrs, robbed of their right to
smile in the death-hour, by the horrid fear
that all eternity will never set the muddle
straight! Jesus, what a sight! the sight of
the factories, right through, from the tiniest
monkey-faced minder, up to the gaudy
boss-bird in his mahogany cage. This organised
labour? fie! oh fie! Organised? for
what? for the sake of the labour, or for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">(168)</span>
the sake of the labourer—the only product
that really counts—for the sake of the cottons,
or for the sake of the garment-stuff for the
souls of men? Is labour man’s end, or his
means? his master, or his ministrant? Surely
the first true end of making cottons well is
to make the maker better. And, if one must
be spoiled in the process, for Heaven’s sake
let it be the cottons, though, of that, no need.
Every thread of their fineness must come
out of some inner fineness in him. How pathetically
absurd to have them smooth, and
white, and close-textured, and firm in the
pull, and him coarse, foul, loose-minded, tearing
in the Devil’s hand under any strain of
lust or rage! But why insist on a commonplace
when all the wisest feel that truth, and
speak it now? The work exists for the
worker; let us never cease to proclaim it,
and have done with the old lie—the worker
for the work. How sad the sight when you
pass from one to the other! The expectation
born naturally of the fine thing is always
of some finer animate thing behind. Hence
the craving for sight and knowledge of
heroes. But see the slop-made piece of human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">(169)</span>
handiwork that skulks as maker, behind the
screen of drawing-room intrigue, or behind
my lady’s fan—shabby, shambling, beer-bedewed,
only so much of him washed as
might soil the satins and brocades he shapes
for others’ uses! Go into the dismal slums
that manufacture for Mayfair, and follow the
dainty casket for jewels from one end to the
other of the line—from the rickety workshop,
airless, and only not lightless, too, because the
light is wanted for the labour, to the still
daintier casket for men and women, in which
it finds its cushioned rest. If this beautiful
correspondence, why that grotesque incongruity?
If these who touch it as owners are
as fine as itself, why not, also, they who touch
it as makers, at least with the inner fineness,
and a certain amplitude of material life? But
no: a dozen have died to all the true
ends of being to make that pretty toy, have
been reared in the belief that all the fineness
they have is to go into that direct,
and not, in the first place, into their own
lives.</p>

<p>For nothing sanctifies a wrong, not even
a headache in doing it; and ‘honest industry,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">(170)</span>
which makes of patience and thrift but the
foothold for its spring upon the back of
stupidity or improvidence, is the sinfullest sin
of all. Be not so sanctified of air, O new
hot-gospeller of work! Your sole right over
knaves and fools is but the right to help them
to better wisdom out of your heart and hand.
Your virtue was not given to you for investment
at forty per cent. The knaves and fools
are diseased—that is all; and you, when you
stoop to personal profit out of their infirmity,
are worse diseased than they. A terrible
malady, yours, of hard work to self-regarding
ends; infectious to the last degree; a sort of
dry rot of life.</p>

<p>Believe this—individualism, self-help, to
any other end than the help of all, is the great
untruth. Believe it, in spite of the Smiling
apostle, who has done more harm with the
nostrum of his title than Abernethy with
his invention of blue-pill. Go on being self-helpful,
if you must, for thirty, forty centuries
more; only not for ever! Take a lease of
five times nine hundred and ninety-nine years,
yet fix some term! Give us a little hope, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">(171)</span>
name the happy day when the freehold of light
and life and jouissance shall revert to all.</p>

<p>Try the other thing as a regimen, once in
a way, as a new diet for your soul’s health—as
a new quack medicine, then, powerfully
recommended by a sufferer: will that appeal?
One poor little pill—it cannot hurt overmuch.
Cut off some of the work that ministers but
to your ease and luxury, and that, with
interest piled on interest of infamous wrong,
makes the ever-growing load of sorrow for
the mass. Cease to be competitive and self-helping,
at least in precious moments when
you feel your heart sick. Go back to it, if
you will, if you can, when you feel a man
again, as convalescents resume their mulligatawny
and hot lobster when the plainer
roast and boiled have set them right. Treat
your mind like a stomach, and give it a touch
of nature once in a while. Then, if you have
a taste that way, still return for your gorge
at the banquet of work. Only, try to include
in it some concern for the most truly helpless,
the stupid and the base, and to find the relish
in the end rather than the means. For the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">(172)</span>
end is not to make riches of mind, body, or
estate for yourself, but to lift up life for one
and for all.</p>

<p>This is how I interpret Victoria. This is
what I think she means. Let me put it to the
proof.</p>

<span class="title">A LORD OF INDIA.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">I have to tell her one day of the Empire, the
power, the stretch of it, the count in millions
of miles, in millions of souls; the largest empires,
living or dead, mostly but parishes
beside hers and mine. In mere size, Russia,
even, beaten by an eighth, the Grand Republic
beaten all but three times over, the
late Darius the Great beaten five times clear—more
than forty Germanys, more than fifty
Spains! Our own Mother Island but a dot in
a waste beside it, Victoria’s Island but a dot
on the dot, the parasite of a midge. With
this, the figures for commerce, the figures for
sails on all the seas that wash the ball, the
figures for wealth—a round nine thousand
millions sterling, if we were sold up to-morrow,
and, for all the bad years since ‘seventy-five,
a steady hundred and eighty millions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">(174)</span>
added year by year to the hoard—our
swelling liver almost putrid with the gorge of
gold.</p>

<p>Victoria is delighted; wants to measure
Pitcairn with her sash—is stopped; becomes
light of heart, effusive; carolleth;
offers to take me to the Cave on the
ledge, for a treat—the Cave of the Great
Scrape, I have always called it—pays me a
sort of reverence, as one who has come from
the sun of this colossal system—is stopped
again. Then, after purring foolishly over the
totals, like a great happy kitten that has got
all the thread in the world for a ball, asks to
have them unravelled in measured inventory.
Is told something about Australia, about
Canada, about the Indies. Seems to see it all
with ever-dilating pupils, as a child before a
pageant of pantomime. Sees it in procession
of countless tribes, armies, emblemed industries,
brother peoples, subject kings; warriors
coated in mail, in crimson, or only in the
black of their own skins; priests bearing every
symbol, from the notched stick to the cross;
mechanics, from them that smooth with the
flint hatchet to them that smooth with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">(175)</span>
Whitworth plane; Nature’s experiments with
the type, from the bushman to the man from
Mayfair. At this, and long before the procession
closes, shows signs of worshipping
me again, as a sort of deputy lord of India
and the other dependencies in Europe, Asia,
Africa, and America. But I turn away.</p>

<p>For modesty forbids, not to speak of the
fear of detection. All the lords of India are
not so plump; and I sometimes wonder what
the lordship means. I am a lord of India, it
is true, but so is Snip there, in his sweating-shop,
and Swart carrying the sandwich-board,
‘lords of human kind,’ as it was once put; but
let us keep within bounds. I think of the
lordship whenever I meet Swart, whenever I
take stock of all the figures that make the
huge stain of shabbiness upon our moving
crowds. A lord of India, too, the man in
threadbare who turns out every morning from
Kentish Town or Somers, or other of the
circumjacent wastes, to look for a job in the
City, plodding steadily forward for the hundredth
time, with fifteen shillings a week as
the goal of hope. Clean shaven this lord, got
up for ‘respectable appearance,’ down to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">(176)</span>
last ha’penny, in shining boots, inked for the
cracks and patches, and shining coat; everything
shining about him, but the hard and
hopeless face. He is certainly of the Imperial
breed—no one can deny him that—a lord of
India, an heir to the ages of struggle and
victory on battle plains dotting our fifth of
the globe.</p>

<p>But Swart is the best example, and Victoria
is easily stimulated to the entreaty that I will
tell of him all I know. It is worth telling, in
good faith.</p>

<p>‘I first met Swart in Regent Street, a little
while before I came out here. He was sandwiched
between two boards of “India in
London,” and there was something so spiritually
picturesque in the ruin of him, from his
baggy hat to his mere suggestion of a boot,
that it drew me to his side. I was drawn by
curiosity rather than by pity, as a naturalist
who might want to see how the wood-louse
lives.’</p>

<p>‘Where is Regent Street? and what is a
sandwich-man?’ said Victoria as I began the
tale.</p>

<p>‘We must reserve all that for the footnotes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">(177)</span>
If I am to keep on moving, you must
let me get under way.’</p>

<p>‘Well, we struck up acquaintance, Swart
and I. Did I say that he was tallish, thin,
bent, and grizzled, and foul? I want to get
all that over as soon as may be. Sixty, or
thereabouts, I should say, as to age; a not
unkindly face, and not unhandsome, but for
its furrows and puckers of mean cares—a
good face spoiled.’</p>

<p>‘I wish I knew what a sandwich-man is,’
she murmured; ‘but it does not signify.
Please go on.’</p>

<p>‘We struck up acquaintance, and I used
to walk with him up and down his beat—he
in the gutter, I on the kerb. He had been a
soldier, and had helped to win India back for
England at the storming of Lucknow. He
was quite proud of the whole achievement,
and of his share in it. “They was nigh slipping
clean away, sir,” he would say of his
Indian fellow-subjects. “You cannot think
how nigh they was; but we just cotched ’em
by the tail.” It was pleasant to see Swart
proud of anything; it did so much to improve
his air. At such moments, he seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">(178)</span>
almost a man. They were but sun-rifts in a
black sky, of course. Sometimes the policeman
would threaten to run him in, for trespassing
on the kerb with the edge of his
board. This would tend to drive him wide
of the gutter; then, his foreman would come
by, and growl an oath at him for not walking
straight in his furrow, and threaten him with
the sack.’</p>

<p>‘“The sack!”’ said Victoria softly; ‘“run
him in!” I am not interrupting, you know, I
am only saving up.’</p>

<p>‘I asked Swart to let me go and see him,
but he said “Not yet.” He was living in a
common lodging-house, and he was not allowed
to receive visitors. “If I was allowed,” he
said frankly, “I shouldn’t like you to come.
They really ain’t fit company for a gentleman,
or, for that matter, for a common man. We
had three took out of their beds last night for
robberies from the person, and one for burglary
and murder. What with the police
coming in and out of the room, and flashing
their lights on your faces, there was no getting
a wink. There was sixty sleepin’ in our room,
and the row woke most of us up. You may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">(179)</span>
fancy what it was after that. Besides, I’m
gettin’ too old to fight for my place by the
kitchen fire, and I’m cold half the time. Then,
if you ain’t got your fourpence every night,
out you go; and I can’t tackle the Embankment
no more. I want a place of my own.”’</p>

<p>‘You might tell me about the Embankment
now,’ she said, ‘but, of course, we’ll make a
note of it, if you are going to get cross.’</p>

<p>‘It is an open thoroughfare, the finest in
London, bordered, on one side, by gardens
and public palaces, on the other, by the river.
The people who cannot afford to sleep as
Swart sleeps are allowed to sleep there, as a
favour, for it is against the law.’</p>

<p>‘But do you mean to say——?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, indeed, I do; that is just what I do
mean.’</p>

<p>‘But how <em>can</em> the others go to bed, then?’</p>

<p>‘Well, how can you, for that matter, now
you know it? You get used to such things.’</p>

<p>‘I would never go to bed if I lived there.
Never, at least, till——?’</p>

<p>‘A week or two later Swart told me that
his place was ready, and that I might call.
He had been saving slowly for his furnishing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">(180)</span>
for, as he observed, what can you do on
1<abbr>s.</abbr> 3<abbr>d.</abbr> a day? He merely “had his eye” on
a table. I let him keep his eye on it. The
experiment was too interesting to be spoiled
by help from me.</p>

<p>‘His place was in White Horse Yard.
White Horse Yard, you must know, Victoria,
is a London slum, one of hundreds as clearly
marked on the map, and as well known, as
Buckingham Palace or Grosvenor Square.
The description would interest you, as a
semi-savage, but to us worn children of civilisation
it is too trite for pleasure or profit.
Every social reformer begins by describing
White Horse Yard: it is the sign of the
“’prentice hand.” Swart’s place was reached
by a narrow causeway, reeking with every
kind of abomination, and by a staircase, dark
and rotten, and swarming with vermin, as I
had afterwards good reason to know. Here,
at the summit, was his back garret, with his
bed of shavings, and his table, made of a
packing-case turned upside down. His neighbours
worked at many trades, including that
most ancient one of private plunder. The
front garret was the home, as distinct from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">(181)</span>
the place of business, of “one of them gals.”
Swart could never be induced to be more explicit.
On the floor below, they made lawn-tennis
aprons at threepence a dozen, and
army coats. They did something with rabbit-skins
in the back drawing-room, for, one day,
when Swart opened his window for air, we
were nearly choked with a furry adulteration
of the precious fluid that came in with the
fog. A housebreaker who had been out of
work for six months or more, owing to an
injury received in a scuffle with a policeman,
occupied the front kitchen, and, by general
consent, he was the quietest man in the house.
The back kitchen—but no, nothing of these
premises below the ground level, if you please;
nothing, even in distant allusion, in veiled hint;
nothing about the back yard either, or about
the water-butt therein! If you are going to
be foolish, Victoria, I shall just leave off.’</p>

<p>‘I am not foolish.’</p>

<p>‘What are you crying about?’</p>

<p>‘If we let people live so, we should be
afraid of God; I think we should be afraid
of every thunderstorm.’</p>

<p>‘The lightning is very tender with us—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">(182)</span>
chimney-stack now and then; seldom the
steeple of a church.’</p>

<p>‘It is not true. You are just saying
things to me. There are missions in all the
cities to look after the poor people. I have
read books.’</p>

<p>‘Of course. There were four missions in
this very circumscription of Swart’s, and one
Inspector of Public Health.</p>

<p>‘The chief thing the missionaries preached
was the sanctity of submission, or that sanctity
of property which had made this dismal
hole what it was. They preached it in a
pair of parlours, only less dismal than Swart’s
garret. Their object was to effect a change
of heart as a condition precedent to the
change of linen—the cart before the horse.
Of the night of material ugliness around that
was, on one side, the parent of all this spiritual
ugliness, they seemed to have no idea. On
Sunday, some of the poor people in the yard
went to the preaching, dubiously, yet still
hoping there might be something in it, their
dim intuitions of logic being hardly strong
enough to expose the mockery of its gospel
of love. Others went to the drink-shops, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">(183)</span>
they were the wiser, for they found a little
brightness there. There was one drink-shop
to every two hundred inhabitants; and the
missionaries, who were quite as dull as their
hearers, never understood the reason why.</p>

<p>‘Swart read his paper meanwhile, and
joined the crowd in the “pub,” when he had
a penny to spare. He never missed his paper,
being quite a hopeful kind of fool, and inclined
to believe that the better luck was just
going to begin. He had revelled in that
anticipation, from Sunday to Sunday, for at
least five-and-thirty years. The foreign intelligence,
especially, used to cheer his soul.
We were always taking something to round
our Empire off; soon it would be quite trim,
and then! “You may reckon we’ve got
Burmah, sir,” he said to me one day, when
news came of the execution of a fresh batch
of dacoits. “It’s as good as ours. There’ll
be fine times, I’m thinking, soon. Such a
rumpus, indeed, when it’s all for their good!”
He was really angry with the Burmese. He
regarded their war, and all the other little
wars, as only so many accidents of human
perversity that tended to defer the grand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">(184)</span>
opening of a vast humanitarian entertainment
known as “Better times all round.”
He had hoped the curtain was going to
rise, when India was quieted down, in the pit.
Then came the stupid interruptions from the
Abyssinian and Ashantee sections of the
gallery. Then the Afghan and Zulu fights at
the doors. Next, “them there fellers in the
Soudan.” Now, “the Burmah lot.” Swart
had been waiting through all this for a
curtain that never stirred.’</p>

<p>‘The curtain is to hide the stage when
they are changing the scenery,’ she said,
wandering from the subject for a moment,
like the big child she was. ‘It is let down
five times in most of Mr. Shakespeare’s plays.
I know.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, you know, Vickey, and so did Swart.
Swart was just the man for that kind of
stage-play, being one of those profounder
fools who take everything as it is offered to
them, and who will very contentedly accept
two deal boards and a sheet of canvas for a
blossoming tree. They had told him that he,
too, was a lord of India, and he believed it;
and he was quite touched, as with the sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">(185)</span>
of an accession of personal dignity, when his
Sovereign was made Empress as well as
Queen. As he would often observe, all the
people in his court were lords of India, if they
only knew it, heirs to the Great Mogul—for
he had a smattering of history—conquerors
at Plassey, Mooltan, Moodkee, Sobraon, and
the rest. All Clare Market and Collier’s
Rents, and all the Minories had their share in
that great heritage, yet they never gave it a
thought.</p>

<p>‘They could not be got to see it in that
way, there was the difficulty. Swart had
endless arguments with them on the calm
Sabbath afternoons, while they waited at the
street corners, ankle deep in slush, for the
opening of the houses. He would hurl his
figures at their heads; totals for imports and
exports, the growth in shipping, the growth
in trade. There was sometimes an inert
obstructive force in their stupidity against
which he could not prevail. The brighter
witted mocked him openly, and always led
the argument back from the pageant of
Empire to his own rags. The duller merely
spat, but there was dissent in their expectoration;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">(186)</span>
and sometimes he was obliged to fancy
they spat at him. He would ask me for help
in his strait, and I lent him some of the
popular literature of Federation, where the
right arguments are all set down.’</p>

<p>‘We have begun praying for Federation,
every Sunday—just after the Collect. The
schoolmaster is writing a Federation hymn.’</p>

<p>‘Try to interrupt me as little as you can,
my dear. It checks the flow. Make notes,
and we’ll settle it up afterwards.’ (She took
off her girdle and tied a knot for ‘Federation.’)</p>

<p>‘But I felt less interest in Swart’s dealings
with others than in his dealings with
himself. That was the ever-present wonder.
I found, on probing his wound of penury,
that he had been waiting for relief, not for
five-and-thirty years merely, but, in a sense,
for five hundred. He was of a most ancient
stock, as indeed are most of us, if you will
but think of it; and for all the years it had
flourished on this earth, in so far as the
straining vision could trace it through the
night of time, that stock had never escaped
from its parent dunghill. And Swart’s gaze
carried back very far. For a man of his class,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">(187)</span>
he had a quite exceptional knowledge of
family history, partly oral, partly recorded
on the fly-leaf of a family Bible, which, for
the purpose of our researches, I lent him the
money to get out of pawn.’ (She tied another
knot at ‘pawn.’)</p>

<p>‘The Swarts knew themselves as far back
as Anne; nay, with allowances and conjectural
emendations, as far back as the second Charles.
Here, then, was my opportunity, unique, as
far as I know, to get at a real pedigree of a
Poor Stupid; how infinitely more interesting
than any pedigree of the baronage, if only
by reason of its rarity. I encouraged him,
therefore, by every means in my power, to
leave the current affairs of the Empire for a
season, and to talk about the past of his own
race. He was nothing loath, and, after weeks
of labour, we had a family tree drawn out for
him that, for hoary age, might not have been
unworthy of a seventh Earl. We had sometimes
to make a perilous leap from bough to
bough, as in the best performances of this
description, but we kept that secret to ourselves.’</p>

<span class="title">PEDIGREE OF A POOR STUPID.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">‘Swart then, to cast it in proper form, was of
the Swarts of Norfolk, and his family had
been settled in that part of the country from
an extremely early time. They had <span class="cor" title="Source: subse quently" id="cor188">subsequently</span>
removed to London, and had planted
offshoots in many of the great towns, but their
earliest family seat was a swineherd’s hovel
on the bank of one of the Broads. Swart’s
father, Jeremiah Swart, more commonly
known as “Jerry,” had assisted at the rise of
our great cotton industry, not exactly as one
of the cotton lords, but as one of the others.
Swart had often heard his history from his
own lips. He was born in 1800, and in 1816
he took another infant to wife, without the
formality of a visit to the parson. Babes of
every age, from five and six upwards, were
common enough in the factories at that time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">(189)</span>
and they worked from twelve to fourteen and
fifteen hours a day. Puberty began early, for
the temperature of the factories was the temperature
of Bombay, yet, even with this
chance in their favour, half the children never
reached a marriageable age. They perished
like flies, and the few that were left, like flies
of a certain sort, had just time to arrange for
the propagation of their species, and then to
die. Boys and girls, men and women, worked
together, lived together. Inspection was unknown;
control of any sort, on the part of
law, equally so; their common lodging-houses,
not to put too fine a point on it, were common
stews. They toiled for just as much as would
keep their bodies together; and the rate of
pay was calculated on the sound economical
assumption that they had no souls.</p>

<p>‘Swart’s father seems to have taken the
same interest in public affairs as his more
famous son. He would often tell the boy of
his patriotic satisfaction in the Act of 1816,
which regulated the detention of Napoleon at
St. Helena. He felt, as he used to say, that
they had got Boney safe at last, and he
could now breathe as freely as his fluffy cough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">(190)</span>
would allow. Swart’s infant mother was
indifferent to that great event, for she was
bearing Swart in her bosom, at the factory,
within three days of her delivery of him into
this joyous world. Having performed this
function, she went to join her ancestors, whose
pedigree, I regret to say, it is impossible to
trace. Swart’s father used to remark that he
had been less fortunate than Prince Leopold,
who, on taking the Princess Charlotte to wife,
at about this time, secured 50,000<abbr>l.</abbr> a year
with her, dead or alive. He meant to say,
of course, that the grant was to be continued
to the Prince in the event of the lady’s demise.
It was a generous gift, for the nation had
been left in extreme poverty and misery by
the great war. The Marquis Camden subsequently
surrendered his sinecure, “towards the
relief of the public burdens,” in the handsomest
way in the world, and the Prince Regent
found he could spare 50,000<abbr>l.</abbr> a year from his
own ample revenues, for the same purpose.
Swart’s father was particularly touched by
this last act of self-denial, and he expressed a
hope that his Prince might never want a
meal. The wish must have been heard in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">(191)</span>
Heaven. The people at large were not so
fortunate: they became like wild beasts with
hunger; they rioted at Ely, they rioted at Spa-Fields.
The country blazed with incendiary
fires, as though for a second celebration of
the Peace. The hero who had conquered the
Peace was not forgotten; and Strathfieldsaye
was purchased for the Duke of Wellington.</p>

<p>‘Swart’s father had once enjoyed the
felicity of seeing his Grace, and had taken
so careful a note of him that he knew the
number of buttons on his blue frock-coat. It
was not his only souvenir of greatness:—“Father
once met the Marquis of Waterford,
when his lordship was out on one of his larks.
The Marquis gave father a black eye, and
half a crown.”’</p>

<p>Victoria knotted something again: I fancy
it was ‘black eye.’</p>

<p>‘Darkness covers the Swarts for a brief
space, but in the middle of the eighteenth
century they flash into view again with
“Father’s great grandfather,” sold into the
Plantations for indigence, in the flower of his
age. Some of the workers had their fixed
term of servitude, just like the burglars now;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">(192)</span>
their masters were at liberty to whip them, and
to impose additional years of servitude, if they
ran away. “He got nabbed in a rumpus,”
says Swart, “when they was taking old Commodore
Anson’s treasure to the Tower. You
look in the books, sir; you’ll find that right.
This here Commodore had sailed round the
world, and had made many rich prizes;
and a million and a quarter in treasure was
taken down to the Tower to be stowed away.
There was thirty-two waggon loads of it,
the old man counted ’em, and somehow our
family’s never forgot the number. All our
sort turned out, as you may fancy, to see the
waggons go by. Father’s grandfather was a
bit pushed at the time, and used to sleep on a
brick kiln, with a few other chaps out of luck.
There was no sleep that night; they couldn’t
have closed their eyes, he said, if it had been
a bed of down. It was such a great day
for England! They all sat up singin’ songs
out in the fields, till it was time to start and
see the procession. The old man allus said he
wasn’t a bit drunk, for he hadn’t tasted bite
or sup that day. It was the sight of the
waggons, somehow, seemed to make him turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">(193)</span>
faint. Anyhow, I suppose he behaved foolish,
for they collared him, and as I told you, he
was sold off. He couldn’t give no account of
hisself—they’ve allus been very hard on you
for that. Father’s grandfather’s wife went
out after him, all the way to this ’ere Plantation,
wherever it was. It took her three
months to go, but she lost his address, and
so she had to come back. They never met
again. She once did some washing for Mr.
Pitt, him that was made a nobleman: you’ll
find that right. She died at the washtub,
that was the end of her. She was a game
’un, she was; no mistake about that!”’</p>

<p>Poor Vickey! I see the great drops
gathering, and I know they are just going to
roll over: so I push on.</p>

<p>‘“Some of our women didn’t turn out so
well. I don’t want to foul my own nest, sir,
you understand, but it’s sometimes a great
struggle in a poor man’s family to get enough
to eat for growing gals. They always aimed
above ’em though, our women did: I will
say that. One of ’em took up with a master
bootmaker in Bond Street by the name of
Simmons—made for the Royal Family. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">(194)</span>
was my grandmother, as she might be called.
I’ve heard that I might give myself the name
of Fitz-Simmons, if I chose, but Swart’ll do
for me. I only mention it to show that she
had not demeaned herself so much as some
might think.</p>

<p>‘“Father’s grandfather was the man in the
corner of one of Mr. Hogarth’s pictures—the
one ’avin’ his ’ed battered with the pewter.
Ah, they was ’igh old times!”</p>

<p>‘I could but regard this reference to a
family portrait as another note of antiquity of
race. There was even some trace of a family
library in a street ballad sung by a progenitor
of Swart at the Coronation of George IV., and
still in excellent preservation between the fly
leaves of the book of Truth. In rugged, but
heartfelt and effusive verse, it called on the
whole earth to rejoice. A family museum of
curios, often another note of lineage, was
wanting, except in so far as it might be found
in a red waistcoat that had belonged to Mr.
Townsend, the famous Bow Street runner, who
had “once locked grandfather up.” Swart
had heard that it was worth money, but he
could never get more than sixpence on it at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">(195)</span>
the tally shop, and he had offered it in vain
to Madame Tussaud.</p>

<p>‘Here the Bible record, and Swart’s
memory of the direct oral tradition ended, but
I could not have his story stop. I, therefore,
went down to the Heralds’ College, and to the
Record Office, and by liberal fees to certain
yellow men called searchers, found out a
good deal more. They proved to me beyond
question, as I had long expected, that the
Swarts had been always with us as actors in
the great drama of history, only the managers
had not thought it worth while to give them
a line in the bills. As soon as I made it
worth while to search beyond the bills, Swarts
seemed to become as plentiful as blackberries.
We found that nothing had been done without
them. Dig down into the foundation of
any fair structure of Imperial greatness, and
you were pretty sure to come upon a Swart,
if only as rubbish for the filling-in. One
of them was certainly among the two-and-seventy
thousand vagrants hanged, or otherwise
despatched, in the reign of Bluff King
Hal. They were enclosing a good deal at
that time, and the Bluff one had broken up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">(196)</span>
the monasteries, where the Swarts had often
found a meal. These operations filled the
country with vagrants, and the vagrants had
to be removed. They were flogged, and fined
in one of their ears, for a first offence, and
hung up like flitches, for a second, and thus
effectually cured. A Swort or Swyrt, of
Norfolk, which, as before stated, was their
country seat, had been branded as an able
bodied loiterer as far back as 1547.</p>

<p>‘To form an idea of their situation, one
must watch a fly trying to crawl out of a pot
of jam. You leave him there in the morning:
you find him there at night. Never, never,
in the summer’s day, nor in dateless eternity,
shall that fly get clear!’</p>

<p>‘You talk cruel on purpose: somebody
just helps him out.’</p>

<p>‘Victoria, give me a chance! Suppose
nobody helps him. When, by heroic labour,
he has cleared his forelegs, his wings are still
coated with the sugary mire; and, as he plants
the forelegs down, to attend to the rest of
him, the forelegs are besmeared again. Let
him resolve to leave them behind, in his desperation,
and he will but lose his balance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">(197)</span>
and foul the wings once more. Poor fly!
Poor Swart! Poor, Poor Stupids! whose
history through the ages is my humble theme.
The only difference is that the Swarts are
sunk in slime instead of jam, and that they
have the power of breeding there, and leaving
their heritage of fruitless struggle to countless
generations. Always the slime is peopled
with this race, and never shall they get out,
till God send a brother to scrape them. The
tragi-comedy of the situation is found when
one, by miracle of discovery of a brother’s
body for foothold, wriggles himself free, and
then stands on the brink, to comfort the
others with Penny Readings from the author
of “Self Help.”</p>

<p>For full seven centuries, as I could trace
it now, had the Swarts been waiting for the
deliverer with a potsherd. Their history was
a history of illusions in the belief that he had
come at last. Once, clearly, they thought it
was Kett, for there was a Swart in his rebellion
in 1549. I hear him at their foolish
Litany of human rights: “Look at them
and look at us! have we not all the same
form, are we not all born in the same <span class="cor" title="Source: way?’" id="cor197">way?”</span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">(198)</span>
Eternal protest! Nature’s everlasting whisper
to the innermost heart of man—never sufficiently
answered by a knock on his head
from the outside! The Earl of Warwick and
his mercenaries were prompt enough with
this response, yet the Swarts were still unconvinced.
There was a Swyrte—I can but
think it was the same family, and I am
confirmed in that opinion by one of our
kings-at-arms—in Wat Tyler’s affair, in the
fourteenth century. The conjecture is that
he was one of the “landless men,” whom the
lawyers of the time were trying to bring back
into serfage, after their extremely informal
manumission by the Black Death. Nearly
sixty thousand persons, it may be remembered,
perished of that pest in Norwich alone,
and this had probably convinced the Swyrtes
that it was time to be stirring. A sort of
insane joy in the ravage wrought by the disorder,
as in a clearance for right and freedom,
by the Devil as redeemer, is apparent in
some of the sayings of the time; and the
surviving Swyrte in the train of Tyler may
have felt, in his extremity, that he was open
to a fair offer from that other side. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">(199)</span>
sentiment is perhaps hereditary, for I remember
to have noticed a strange elation in
the Swart of the Victorian era, when the late
visitation of Asiatic cholera was threatened,
or as, I fear, he took it, promised, to our
shores. His manner exhibited the tremulousness
of a great uncertain hope, and his reading
of the telegrams from Marseilles and Paris
in his Sunday paper took a rhythmic cadence,
as though they were portions of a saga. The
circumstance is perhaps, incidentally, suggestive
of his Norse descent, but we must not
go too far. Local Kentish records tend to
show that the earlier Swyrte just mentioned
had risen to a certain eminence in the movement,
the highest perhaps the family ever
attained, for a man of that name undoubtedly
acted on one occasion, as deputy tub-bearer
to the “mad priest of Kent,” John Ball. Ball,
as we know, was preaching, five centuries
ago, just what they are preaching at Clerkenwell
Green to-day. “Good people, things will
never go well in England so long as goods be
not in common, and so long as there be villains
and gentlemen. But what right are they
whom we call lords greater folk than we?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">(200)</span>
Why do they hold us in serfage? If we all
came of the same father and mother, of Adam
and Eve, how can they say or prove that they
are better than we, if it be not that they make
us gain for them by our toil what they spend
in their pride? They are clothed in velvet,
and warm in their furs and their ermines,
while we are covered with rags. They have
wine and spices and fair bread; and we eat
oat cake and straw, and water to drink.
They have leisure and fine houses; we have
pain and labour, the rain and the wind in the
fields. And yet it is of us, and of our toil, that
these men hold their state.” We may easily
imagine the effect of such words on one of
this stupid race.</p>

<p>‘When Ball was thrown into prison, his
deputy tub-bearer seems to have joined Tyler
as a man of action, for the name turns up in
a rude muster-roll of the gathering at Blackheath.
He was possibly one of the band that
forced their way into the Tower, and pulled
the beards of the scandalised knights, promising
to be their equals and good comrades
in the time to come. He never came within
touch of chivalry again, unless he happened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">(201)</span>
to be among that village remnant of revolt
that fell under its maces in the wood at
Billericay, after a two days’ fight, for “the
same liberties as their lords.” But this is only
matter of supposition, and it is more likely
that the Swyrte of Blackheath simply sneaked
into town on the death of his leader, to root
his offshoot of this great family in the London
slime.</p>

<p>‘I cannot find any trace of a Swart at
Cressy or at Poitiers, though many of that
sort unquestionably left their bones in France.
They were not without a monument, however,
but it was in their works. <i lang="la">Circumspice.</i> It
was in the wasted fields of Aquitaine, the
stretches of utter solitude, the patches of
direst poverty, league upon league of burnt
homesteads, and of famine-struck hordes going
mad with misery and rage. For the French
lords being captive, the French serfs had
naturally to raise the money for their ransom,
and the agony of the operation at such a
season of ravage drove them into sheer revolt.
The captive lords, after the manner of their
order, exhibited an admirable self-control;
and, with much dignity, took their meals with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">(202)</span>
the family in the English castles, while they
awaited the remittances that were to set them
free. So blood will always tell! The Swarts
of England, to their ruin, had wrought this
ruin to the Swarts of France—as it was in the
beginning, and, probably, ever shall be, world
without end. Victoria, there is a final word!’</p>

<p>But she only smiled faintly, and shook her
head.</p>

<p>‘Here, I confess, I quite lose the scent of
this interesting race, strong as it must naturally
be. That some of them were doing
something at the time of the Conqueror, the
heralds, and even the physiologists, assure me
is beyond a doubt. I have looked for them
in the Bayeux Tapestry; and in one prostrate
figure that is being used as a foot warmer,
while his betters are presumably enjoying a
view of the English landscape, I fancy I recognise
the family nose. For my own part, I
am tolerably certain that some of them were
alive at Troy time, and that somebody was
sitting on them then.</p>

<p>‘A wonderful old family, the Swarts, the
Percys of the record but a set of <i lang="fr">parvenus</i>
beside them, a family that, in all ages, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">(203)</span>
helped to make the dark background for the
picture of the beauty and the pride of life;
for the frolic group of Chaucer, for Cressy’s
firework blaze of triumph, for the Armada,
for Blenheim, and for Waterloo; for the
grandiose spectacle of pomp and vanity in
every field. Hey! for the idle literature that
all this while could sing its blasphemous song
of perfumed bowers, while the wynd reeked;
for the idle art that could find nothing more
serious than a scheme of colour in the contrast
between these Royal purples and these
beggar’s browns! And hey! for the old, old
Swarts, the true Ancients of Days! Surely
they are as venerable as the Vedas, and, beside
them, the best of merely historic stocks
is but a mushroom growth. What a struggle
among the tuft-hunters to get the Swarts to
dinner, could they but see this! Such a
family only want a blazon, to commend them
to the world. I would suggest a Jackass,
gules, between a stick (uplifted) and a bundle
of wet hay. Motto (the same as that of the
old King of Bohemia—blind, like the whole
race that bear it in good faith): “I serve.”
Crest: a Fool’s cap. Ever has that cap of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">(204)</span>
the Swarts gone up for the victory, while the
caps of the Swarts’ leaders have been held
out for the reward. How have the Swarts
shouted, honest folk, as province after province
rolled into the mass of Empire, till it
stretched beyond the purview of the sun!</p>

<p>‘Whatever he had lost through the ages,
Swart’s joint-stock lordship of India remained,
and he was proud of it, as I have tried to
show. A Lascar was associated with him, as
a boardman, in the Indian exhibition: they
were the best of friends, but Swart made a
point of walking first. It was a question of
mere precedence, and it was not unkindly
done; they always took their pipe together,
at the midday halt in the mews. The Lascar
was really Swart’s hierarchical superior, in a
business point of view. He received threepence
a day more than the others, because
his complexion was suited to the character of
the show. With this natural advantage, and
with a turban manufactured with rare self-denial
from the tail of his own shirt, he was
altogether a specialist of publicity for such
things as Indian Bitters, and the Turkish
Bath. He was more of a philosopher than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">(205)</span>
Swart. He had accepted caste as a law of
Nature and of God, while the other, in the
muddled English way, only took it as it came.
He could give chapter and verse for it from
his holy books. “For the sake of preserving
the Universe, the Being supremely glorious
allotted separate duties to those who sprang
respectively from his mouth, his arm, his thigh,
and his foot”—Read the Dharma Sāstra;
and be still!</p>

<p>But the difference, as he was wont to
observe, did not end here, for the foot is a
thing of five toes, and there are toes, and toes.
Chancing one day to meet in the gutter another
Lascar, whom he suspected of a descent from
the little toe, he spat on the ground, and
exhibited every sign of repulsion, though his
countryman, who was advertising an Arabian
gum-drop, was in the same business as himself,
and, to all appearance, was as good a man.
There were really three toes between them,
as he explained to Swart.</p>

<p>There had been an attempt to bring him
into the fold of Christianity, but it broke
down. He had been led to the gate by a
member of a special mission who, without his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">(206)</span>
knowing it, had given his colleague of the
little toe a rendezvous at the same place. He
endured the hateful presence as best he might,
until the rite of Communion required him to
touch the cup that had just been pressed by
the other’s lips. Then he set down the untasted
pledge of love and brotherhood, and
turned away.</p>

<p>‘He had brought his lady over with him,
and she lived in the seclusion of a Whitechapel
zenana, in continual fear of the effect
of our foggy climate on her lord’s remaining
lung. She was far from her own people, and
if she became a widow, how could she hope
to be treated with the requisite indignity
during the funeral rite? Burning was, of
course, out of the question, but who would
tear out her nose-ring, and the cartilage with
it, in the regular respectable way, or buffet
her, and load her with reproaches, for daring
to survive him? She knew her Manu and
her Sāstras as many of our own estimable
poor know their own Holy Books, and they
had taught her that great lesson of humility
to man which, in the end, all such books are
made to teach. “A woman is not to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">(207)</span>
relied on”—she had the text by heart—“a
husband must be revered as a god by a
virtuous wife.” Poor slaves of the slave!
beautiful and tender creatures, ever the most
apt in the learning of subjection! when
will your turn come? Victoria, my tale is
done.’</p>

<p>Victoria toyed with her scarf awhile as
though to remember all the points, then
untied it knot by knot, in sheer weariness
of soul.</p>

<p>‘And is that England, is that the Empire?’
she said, fixing me with her eyes in a way I
did not exactly like.</p>

<p>‘Oh no, not altogether. Don’t let me be
unfair. There are hundreds of square miles
of beauty, refinement, luxury; exquisitely
ordered homes, fine-natured men, courteous,
suave, poised, high-bred from the bone;
white women, oh, so white! some of them
able to read Greek—Learning robed and
perfumed. And for parties, picture galleries,
libraries, when they give their minds to such
things, they are not to be matched. We are
particularly proud of one square mile bounded
by Oxford Street, Piccadilly, Regent Street, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">(208)</span>
Park Lane; and are wont to repeat the boast
at public dinners that, for intelligence, culture,
wit, and the high qualities of civilisation, it
has not its territorial equivalent on the face
of the earth.’</p>

<p>‘The greater shame for them; why do
they leave the other square miles as they
are?’</p>

<p>‘There are charities, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Charities!—ointment for a cancer. What
makes the disease? There must be something
going on that none of you find out. I know
there must be. How can all those fine people
live a day, an hour, till they do find it out?
What do they talk about while they are
having their dinners? I know they could
find it out, if they tried. Let us try and find
it out, before we go home: we have still half
an hour left. I have been thinking, all the
time you talked: it must be selfishness.
Everybody gets what he can, instead of what
he ought, and of course the clever people get
most. Then they give a little of it back to
the Poor Stupids in what you call charity,
and go on making the money and the misery
all the same. That is the way it strikes me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">(209)</span>
How do the rich people get rich? Don’t you
know you can’t be rich without doing wrong,
whether you know you are doing wrong, or
not. Can you now? At the best, even, if
you are not a robber, you are using your
cleverness to take some one else’s share. And
to think of all those people looking so nice,
and smelling like flowers, and talking like
expensive books, and trying to get richer than
other people all the time; oh! the sly things!
How <em>do</em> you grow rich? I wonder how it is
done.’</p>

<p>‘Always, at the beginning, of course, by
getting as much as you can for yourself, and
giving as little as you can to others; buying
in the cheapest, and selling in the dearest is
the accepted phrase. Sometimes, this has
happened so long ago that the possessors are
able to forget it ever happened. They are
usually put up to do the talking about unselfishness.’</p>

<p>‘Just what I thought; so the dealer that
buys the match boxes made in Mr. Swart’s
house buys them, not for what he ought, but
for what he can.’</p>

<p>‘Can is the only ought in practical life.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">(210)</span></p>

<p>‘I see; and that makes the poor people
hungry and cold.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose so.’</p>

<p>‘And when they are very hungry, and
very cold, the dealer, and his well-to-do friends
give them a little soup and a blanket.’</p>

<p>‘That’s about it.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, how funny! how funny! how funny!’</p>

<p>‘What would you have him do?’</p>

<p>‘What would you?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know.’</p>

<p>‘You do know. Is there anything but one
thing—take less himself, and give them more?’</p>

<p>‘Then he would not be so rich as the
other match box makers.’</p>

<p>‘Well?’</p>

<p>‘And he would have to live in a smaller
house.’</p>

<p>‘Well?’</p>

<p>‘And give up his carriage.’</p>

<p>‘Well?’</p>

<p>‘Then he’ll be damned if he’ll do it,
Vickey, so there!’</p>

<p>‘That may be; I am only talking of what
he ought to do. But I think you are wrong.
He would, if he knew, only he does not know.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">(211)</span>
Perhaps the clergyman sometimes forgets to
tell him. Never mind that; let us go on; it
is so amusing. Tell me some other ways of
making money.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you invest in Companies, and take
the profits as they come.’</p>

<p>‘Without asking how the profits are made,
how the people live that make the profits?’</p>

<p>‘Usually so. Now and then the question is
asked, but the questioner is called an eccentric.
There was one shareholder that made
a great fuss about the tramway people, who
are worked almost into brutishness for the
sake of the dividend. It was only a woman,
you know; and her out-of-the-way proceeding
made her quite notorious at once. The truth
is, everybody feels that the poor people would
grind each other just as hard, if they could.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, the poor people would like to be just
as wicked as their betters! Is that what you
mean?’</p>

<p>‘I think it is, Miss Socrates.’</p>

<p>‘But how <em>do</em> the betters spend the money?
What can be the use of it after all?’</p>

<p>‘The use of it? Did you never hear of
yachting, hunting, pretty pictures, pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">(212)</span>
women, good wine? Poor little savage, you
have never had so much as a taste of life!
Why you may spend twenty or thirty thousand
pounds in getting a good breed of race-horses,
if that is your hobby. You get a hobby,
that’s the way it’s done—horses, hounds,
women, pictures, or china, anything will do—and
keep on sinking your money till you
have the rarest and the best.’</p>

<p>‘Is there any taste in that way as to improving
the breed of men? Does a rich man
ever buy a slum, and keep on playing with it
till he has turned it into a paradise?’</p>

<p>‘No; breeding is chiefly done for the shows.’</p>

<p>‘Are all the people in Europe as funny as
that?’ said Victoria, ‘or is it only the English?
But see, the sun has struck the big
banyan: it is dinner time! What a lot you
have told me, but you have only told me half.
There are Rich Stupids, I see, as well as Poor
Stupids, and I think the rich ones are the
worse off.’</p>

<p class="noindent">It has never occurred to me till this moment,
but certainly we two live here alone. There
are a few other people on the Island, I believe,
and I see them every day, but only as pictures.
I talk to them too, but only as one talks to
pictures, not much heeding the answer back.</p>

<p>I have seen the Ancient, of course, and
have had many a talk with him. There are
the evenings; and it is not Victoria all the
time. I am one of the great family, and I
come and go in that unnoticed way which is
the true footing of friendship and love.</p>

<p>I am more particularly aware of the
Ancient just now, because he is issuing a
proclamation. There is to be a public holiday
in celebration of the Queen’s birthday, and
the proclamation is to regulate the order of
proceedings. It is written on a slate, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">(214)</span>
hung outside his Excellency’s hut. He
has been elaborating it for days, with my
modest help, for the text, and Victoria’s, for
the common sense. Whenever we are going
to do anything foolish, she interrupts from
the window, where she sews by the fading
light. She has thus effectually vetoed the
following projects—a review of the garrison;
a banquet with speeches; and a levée at
Government House.</p>

<p>It is all settled now. There is to be a
Spelling Bee at the <span class="cor" title="Source: school-house" id="cor214">schoolhouse</span>, followed by
a lecture on the Antiquities of the Island, by
the schoolmaster. The populace will then be
released for Sports and Pastimes, with prizes
ranging from a nosegay to a sack of potatoes.
For the wind-up, there is to be another lecture,
‘to steady their minds,’ and I am to be the
lecturer.</p>

<p>I fought hard against it; I honestly did,
but I was overborne. ‘Something about
England, sir; we are never tired of that.’
The voice from the window assented, and then
I gave way.</p>

<p>It begins, it begins; never mind the preliminaries,
the blessed day is here! <i lang="fr">Vive la<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">(215)</span>
joie!</i> Three fowling-pieces fire a salute, the first
thing in the morning, and proclaim our revel
to the universe. The Union Jack is run up
at the flag-staff. Our breakfasts are despatched
in a few minutes, and in less than an hour
we are amid the fierce excitements of the Bee.</p>

<p>The competition is open to all comers, but
it is, in effect, confined to the younger folk.
The scholars, in their best, sit at one end of
the schoolroom, with the schoolmaster in
front of them, to call time, and an admiring
audience beyond. The severity of the struggle
betokens much secret preparation. The first
heat is the spelling of proper names from
Scripture. ‘Achaichus’ is attacked with much
spirit, and carried with a shout, but we have
to mourn the loss of some of our number
before the flag waves over the conquered
word. ‘Achaicharus’ yields in time, though
it leaves but few survivors of a forlorn hope.
‘Habaziniah’ covers the field with slain, yet
still we win. ‘Geuel,’ owing to some invincible
difficulty in the placing of the vowels,
plunges many of the competitors into tears.
‘Gezerites’ restores us all to good humour
with a sense of universal failure. We cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">(216)</span>
manage the final ‘s,’ where it is emphatic—a
disability common to all our Island folk.</p>

<p>I pass over the other heats, to come to that
lecture on Antiquities. Like the memorable
trial, it is a function held in the open air.
We break up the Bee, and troop forth, the
man of learning at our head, and examine a
few huge flat stones, which we have seen a
hundred times before. They are the gravestones
of our pre-historic race. There is one
in front of a cottage, whither it has been
removed to make a flag-stone for the porch.
Another lies, where the vanished men left it,
in a field on the other side of the Ridge. We
know what we should find beneath, if we
took it up—a human skeleton sleeping the
long sleep, with a pearl shell for a pillow.
For centuries it has slept there; for centuries
let it sleep on. We cross the Ridge again,
to the Peak where I first met Victoria; and
we are told to look for the traces of four
rude stone figures that once stood there on a
platform, as though to keep eternal watch
upon the sea. Most of us have seen these
traces from our earliest infancy, but we look
for them again with great diligence, and communicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">(217)</span>
the result with the cries appropriate
to sudden and unexpected discovery—all to
please the schoolmaster. We ask how they
came there? what they signify?—’tis a part
of the game. We are told that they afford
undoubted evidence of a remoter Island race.
But how did the race reach the Island?
The lecturer bids us guess. Is there one
of us so ill-bred as to hazard the suggestion
of a boat? Not one! We play out our
honest piece honestly, to the last scene.
We hold our tongues: our virtue, or our
habit, or verbal veracity will not allow us to
do more. A rosy brown infant, who cries
‘I know,’ is hustled to the rear by Victoria,
and has his mouth stopped with an orange.
For that matter, the whole comedy is devoid
of guile.</p>

<p>The lecturer knows that we might all echo
the cry of the infant; only he must have an
opening for his line:—‘How about a raft from
the Gambier Islands, three hundred miles
away?’ ‘Ah, yes, a raft to be sure! But
then, why should they come here?’ It is
impossible to deny him that. ‘Suppose they
came because they couldn’t help it,’ returns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">(218)</span>
the man of lore. ‘That would certainly alter
the case. But how?’ He needs no more.
‘In earlier times, especially, and even within
living memory, it was the custom of the rude
natives of the South Pacific to put their
vanquished enemies on a raft, and commit
them to the mercy of the waves.’ There is
more of it, but this may serve.</p>

<p>‘Come, and I will show you something,’
says the good man; and we follow him again—this
time down the steep path to the market
grove, and up the other steep path to the
settlement, and through the settlement, till we
stop at his own cottage door, and come to a
final halt in his bedroom, which is the museum
of the Island. What matter, if we have
already seen the solitary shelf that holds the
entire national collection! What matter, if
these spear heads and axe heads of stone are
only less familiar to the hand than our own
knives and forks! We are doing a fellow-creature
a kindness—that is enough. And
the way of doing it is so pleasant to ourselves!
It is the ideal combination duty and delight.
For, that walk to the museum was a walk
through the fields of Paradise, with barelegged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">(219)</span>
children for attendant angels, fleet as
any shapes with wings. Behind these, the
bigger lads and lasses, too old for play, too
young for love, trod the rock, as though it
were soft cloud, in the lightness of their
perfect strength. And behind them, man and
maiden, maiden and man, dragged the slow
foot of the deepest spiritual joy. May the
time be far distant when they, too, shall sleep
on the pearl shell!</p>

<p>I have forgotten all about my lecture,
until the schoolmaster reminds me of it, at
the conclusion of his own. He uses the
freedom of a brother artist to make a
courteous inquiry as to my choice of a topic,
and I am obliged to confess that no thought
of preparation for the coming duty has once
entered my mind. ‘We shall expect you to
do your best for us,’ he says, with a smile.
‘I could not venture to do less,’ is my answer,
‘after what I have just heard.’ But this, like
most smooth sayings, leaves us just where we
were. I begin to cast about for a theme.
‘I have seen your festival; how would you
like to hear of a festival on a larger scale,
on the other side of the world? “A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">(220)</span>
Roman Holiday”—what do you think of
that?’</p>

<p>‘But you said you would tell us something
about England.’</p>

<p>‘I mean a holiday in modern Rome; and
modern Rome, you know, is on the banks of
the Thames.’</p>

<p>‘That would do perfectly. Would you
like to sit in my bedroom, and collect your
thoughts?’</p>

<p>‘He will collect nothing there, but stones
and bones,’ says Victoria, who has lingered
with us. ‘He wants watching, if you are to
get any work out of him. Nobody can
manage him, but me. Come, sir, come
along!’</p>

<p>One may be in leading like a bear, or like
a man of genius; and I hope I am not a bear.
My leader makes straight for the Peak, by
the grove sacred to her tenderest thoughts.
She establishes me on the ruins of the platform,
solitary now, for it will not be the scene
of a lecture for another year. As she leaves
me, I receive the order to remain perfectly
still, in profitable meditation, until her return.
I promise, and I perform. I throw myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">(221)</span>
down on my back, watch the floating billions
of light globules that seem to make the
substance of the air, and wonder if each of
them, all proportions preserved, holds a divine
Victoria, and a contemplative Me. What a
conception of the infinite in happiness, if it
could be so! Then, anon, a light footstep
warns me that she is here again; and I leave
all speculation for the sweet and sufficient
certainty that the larger globule holds us two.
She has a basket of fruit in her hand; but
is it Flora or is it Minerva? The emblems
are confusing, for a pencil and a little note-book
lie on the top of the store. The
bananas and the guavas are to make a lunch
for the lonely thinker; the pencil and the
paper are to preserve his precious thoughts
for the lecture, ere they fly away. I stretch
out an eager hand for the eatables, but she
offers me the pencil first.</p>

<p>‘Put down what you have been thinking
about while I was away.’</p>

<p>How doubly delicious it would be if there
were but a shade of coquetry in it; but there
is not—not the shadow of a shade.</p>

<p>‘I have been thinking about the Infinite.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">(222)</span></p>

<p>‘What a waste of time! I thought it was
to be about Roman Holidays.’</p>

<p>‘It! What? Oh, the lecture. Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean to say you have not been—oh,
how lazy you are!’</p>

<p>‘And how silly, you, my Victoria! but I
like you best that way.’</p>

<p>‘What have I to do with it?’</p>

<p>‘So much that, without you, the whole
world——’</p>

<p>‘Will you eat a banana?’</p>

<p>‘I do not mind, if you will eat one too.’</p>

<p>‘I have no appetite.’</p>

<p>‘Nor I.’</p>

<p>‘You seemed quite hungry just now.’</p>

<p>‘So I was.’</p>

<p>She was kneeling with the basket before
her, and she began to straighten her shape,
always, with her, a sign of a certain concentration
of feeling. But she still retained her
posture, and she looked like a fragment of
a grand statue, broken short off at the hem
of the robe.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you think you are a little uncertain
in your sayings and doings, sometimes? If
you are hungry, why won’t you eat?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">(223)</span></p>

<p>‘It is a hunger strike.’</p>

<p>‘What is that?’</p>

<p>‘An invention of the Siberian captives.
When they are very sick of everything, they
strike against their dinners, and die.’</p>

<p>‘You need not starve yourself to get anything
in our gift,’ she said, and her glance
intensified the grave beauty of her face.</p>

<p>It was too delicious; who could have
helped going on?</p>

<p>‘Yes, I know; I have everything, and
still I want one thing more.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, now I understand,’ she said, rising to
her full height, and making a great litter of
fruit and writing materials, as she overturned
the basket. ‘Oh, I understand perfectly; I
know exactly what you want to say. You
need not go on with your half meanings,
in that sly way. You said it once before,
and you promised you would never say it
again.’</p>

<p>Silly Victoria, she has spread all the cards
on the table, and killed the game! One short
half-hour’s lesson in a London boudoir, for
that matter, in a London schoolroom, would
have taught her how to play. This comes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">(224)</span>
being brought up to tell the truth like a
Quaker, by an Ancient in a savage isle.</p>

<p>‘All the same, Victoria, I won’t eat my
lunch.’</p>

<p>‘Dear friend, dear, dear friend, if I might
only say to you all I want to say! But why
do you trouble me so, why do you try to
make me do wrong?’</p>

<p>It was my turn to jump up now, and to
take her hand, which she did not refuse.</p>

<p>‘Victoria, who can contend against you?
You play by your own rules, and mine seems
the sharper’s game. Come, the hunger strike
is over; hand up the fruit.’</p>

<p>Victoria peeled the bananas, and I ate
them. This arrangement was nearly as good
as the best. It was glorious sunshine again in
her face, as in the sky above. ‘Not more
than others I deserve, yet God hath given me
more,’ was my humble grace.</p>

<p>By-and-by, but all too soon, I was left to
my reflections once more. Victoria withdrew,
on the understanding that I should work at
my lecture during her absence. I watched
her to the foot of the slope, fixing myself in
an attitude of meditation when she turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">(225)</span>
to watch me. I saw her skirmishing with a
band of infant wanderers who wanted to climb
to my study, and heading them off, with much
ingenuity, into an orchard beyond the Ridge.</p>

<p>I really tried to work, but it was impossible.
The sounds and sights of the fête
came up to me, on my lofty post of observation,
from all the peopled region of the Isle,
and from the more distant summits on the
other side, that rose like towers from the wall
of rock. Distance subdued every laugh and
shout, every cry of bird or beast, into perfect
harmony with the rhythmic beat of the waves;
and the sounds seemed but varied modes of
musical silence. There was the same harmony
in the tints, seen through the wide stretches
of summer mist. It was sometimes almost
impossible to say where the flowers ended, and
the men and women began. You might tell
it only by the motion of the figures darting in
and out of the patches of blossom, as pursuers
and pursued. The pairs that sauntered soon
became absolutely one with the landscape, as
they moved further from the point of view.
It was exquisite to the sense and to the soul,
as an image of the unity of nature. Sky and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">(226)</span>
earth and sea, man and woman, flower and
tree, seemed but so many forms and manifestations
of one universal element of beauty,
each separate perception of the beholder
realising them in a uniform impression, in
its own way. I was busy with this fancy, face
downwards in the grass, and trying to work
it out in consultation with a wild-flower, when
Victoria surprised me again. If she had
sought my life, it would have been hers, for
she was within a yard of me, before I knew
that she was there.</p>

<p>‘Princess, hear my confession before you
begin to frown. I have done nothing; nothing—nothing
done! Now I <em>will</em> begin, just
whenever you like. Only I cannot work here;
I must go somewhere else.’</p>

<p>‘Home to your own room?’</p>

<p>‘Stuffy!’</p>

<p>‘Where then?’ Tapping the turf carpet
with her naked foot.</p>

<p>‘I know; only I mustn’t say.’</p>

<p>‘Just say it out.’</p>

<p>‘To the Cave; the Cave of the Great
Scrape, where we went before.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">(227)</span></p>

<p>‘Madness! You’ll just be killed, if you
try it.’</p>

<p>‘Was I killed the first time?’</p>

<p>‘I helped you.’</p>

<p>‘I want you to help me again.’</p>

<p>‘I wonder why I like you at all, and I do
like you so much.’ Then, after a pause, ‘If
God meant to let you be killed, He would
never make me help to do it. Come along.’</p>

<p>This feat of engineering having been once
described, the courteous reader may wish to
be spared the repetition of its details. It is
enough to say that I was soon walking along
the narrow ridge, with my eyes closed, by
order, and with my hands on the shoulders of
Victoria, who led the way. Just before the
eyes closed, they caught one look of tenderest
concern in hers that was a thing to remember
for a lifetime. When I was allowed to
open them again, we were both in the Cave.
Victoria left, the moment she saw me safe,
promising to come back in an hour, and
fetch me out.</p>

</div>


<p class="noindent">I was alone with the clouds, the ocean, and
my note-book. I could attend to the note-book,
only by forgetting the ocean and the
clouds; so, after one last look at them, I
retired to the back of the Cave, and set to
work.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Notes for the Lecture.</p>

<p>‘<i>Old England and Old Rome; Parallel.</i>—England,
my friends, you are to understand,
is in the position of Old Rome after the
conquest. She is sitting down to enjoy the
world she has won. She wants no more:
after dinner, the lion would not hurt a fly.
She feels the lassitude of digestion, especially
in governing circles. Yet, somehow, the
duties of empire are still carried on. Rome
fed all her children from the subject realms,
and they all grew lazy. England feeds only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">(229)</span>
some of hers, and, what with need and hunger,
the watch of empire is duly kept. The reliefs
are sent out to the distant provinces; the
pro-consuls come home regularly to die of
liver-complaint in ancestral halls. Take a
bird’s-eye view of our hemisphere, and you
would see its main roads of earth and ocean
speckled with the foam or dust that marks the
movements of her legions. ’Tis a pretty
sight!</p>

<p>‘<i>Holiday Preparations.</i>—The public holidays
in England are ordained by law, and,
three or four times a year, there is a general
suspension of work in this workshop of
the world. It is a Sabbath of popular festivity.
One of its first signs is the general
migration from town of the select few.
All who can possibly manage it get out
of the way—only, of course, to leave more
room for the others. It is just like them.</p>

<p>‘London is given up to its masses, with
all its spacious environs. The streets are
theirs, the parks are theirs. Every lamp-post
in the slums is turned into a screw swing.</p>

<p>‘<i>Adaptiveness of the Race.</i>—The diversions
of infancy among the English masses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">(230)</span>
are of primitive simplicity. The youthful
slummer plays, as the mature savage wrought,
with the rudest tools. His swing is the
knotted fragment of a clothes-line; and, in
the national game, he demands no more than
a bundle of old coats for the wicket, with a
splinter of deal for the bat. This healthy
contempt for “plant” shows the adaptiveness
of the race, its readiness in making the most
of the materials that come to hand. Waterloo
was won in the playing fields of Eton, and
Australia in the playing fields of Seven Dials.
Walk through St. James’s Park on a public
holiday, and you can no longer doubt it.
Cricket is contrived with the implements
aforesaid; football, with an old hat, or a
broken kettle. The same adaptiveness is
shown in all the arrangements: the average
of breech, to the extent of nakedness it has
to cover, may be put at about three-fifths.
Yet there are no glaring whites to mar the
beauty of the landscape; and even the faces
are in a sort of keeping of pale green. Artists
might picture this Bank Holiday scene in the
Park; it could hardly fail to attract attention
at Burlington House. The sicklier children,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">(231)</span>
and the very young, play in the alleys nearer
home, where the dust is considerately left in
sufficient abundance to enable them to make
their mud-pies. Many play in the old graveyards
adjacent to these alleys, recently opened
to them by the munificence of a public-spirited
society. This is perhaps the highest
example of our national readiness to make
the best of circumstances.</p>

<p>‘<i>Note.</i>—Sketch of Tom All Alone’s—real
or supposed—on a public holiday, as one of
the most suggestive sights of the universe:
“Tom All Alone’s; with a few observations
on Russell Court and Vinegar Yard.” Ancient
cemetery or native barrow of district, consisting
of three back-yards rolled into one; now
a public playground, dedicated for ever, etc.,
with becoming circumstance, as local “boon.”
To get it into focus, should be seen from the
meadows about Eton College. So seen, will
inspire sentiments of devout gratitude to God
for the mysteries of patience, far surpassing
the mysteries of faith, in the souls of men.
Tom All Alone’s, as something to be thankful
for. Ha! ha! ha! (try to laugh here). Oh,
by what magic, by what magic, do we get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">(232)</span>
them to take this irreducible minimum in
settlement of the human claim? (try not to
weep).</p>

<p>‘Same adaptability, too, in grown-up
natives of region—veritable note of our race.
Require no costly machinery of enjoyment.
Take a plank of wood, put a row of taps and
glasses on one side, and, on the other, a kind
of horse box in which fifteen or twenty people
may manage to stand upright, and you have
“house of entertainment.” A young woman
turns taps, as fast as she can, and fills glasses;
people in horse-box empty them with equal
dispatch; and public enjoyment is at its
height. Marble tables, public gardens,
flowers, music, not indispensable. A trough
would be simpler still; but horses do not
care for gin, and the higher animal would object
to it, as it implies the unsound principle
of community of goods.</p>

<p>‘Here, in these houses of entertainment,
they exchange their artless confidences, and
settle their family affairs. Not inquisitive
about future; have learned to take short
views. Whenever perplexed about problems
of destiny, and their own relations of joy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">(233)</span>
to this joyous world, they nod to young
woman, who turns tap, and their perplexities
disappear.</p>

<p>‘<i>Note.</i>—The beautiful modesty of their
demand on life might teach even shepherds
a lesson in content. Their simple attainable
standard in wine, in woman, in music, in
light, in joy. Their conversation—direct
and plain, free from tortuous refinements
of studied wit; their badinage, usually no
more than the light play of the pewter on
one another’s heads. All their pleasures of
the same simple description. Will spend
their leisure very contentedly in watching a
dog worrying a pitfull of rats, or two men
beating each other into insensibility with
gloves that only seem to hurt. As childlike
as the North American Indians, and not
unlike them in the race type—high cheek
bones; a wide mouth, massively lipped; slits
for the eyes. See them on the great public
days, pouring out in myriads to a horse race,
boat race, or Lord Mayor’s Show; and own
the wonders of a social and religious system
that has suffered them to find satisfaction in
this state, or us to find content.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">(234)</span></p>

<p>‘Amplify admiration of the system, in the
lyric vein—rhythmic prose, etc.</p>

<p>‘<i>Their Women.</i>—Like their North American
sisters, fond of feathers and bright hues.
No gaudier thing in nature than the coster
girl in her holiday dress of mauve, with the
cruel plume that seems to have been dyed in
blood. Relation of female to male, singular
survival of primitive state. Love-making
always, in form at least, an abduction of the
virgin. A meeting at the street corner in the
dusk, for the beginning of the ceremony;
then a chase round the houses, the heavy
boots after the light ones, with joyous shrieks
to mark the line of flight; after that, the
seizure, the fight, with sounding slaps for
dalliance that might knock the wind out of a
farrier of the Blues. In the final clutch,
skirts part in screeching rents, feathers strew
the ground. Then the panting pair return,
hand in hand, to the street corner, to begin
again.</p>

<p>‘<i>A Night Piece.</i>—Nightfall brings the
whole slum together, at the universal rendezvous,
from every near or distant scene; men,
and those that were once maidens, mumbling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">(235)</span>
age and swearing infancy, stand six-deep before
the slimy bar, till the ever flowing liquor
damps down their fiercest fires, and the great
city is once more at rest. The imagination of
him that saw Hell could hardly picture the
final scene.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>‘Are you ready?’</p>

<p>The voice came from the rock above, and
it was hers.</p>

<p>‘Yes, pining for liberty—please let me
out.’</p>

<p>‘Have you done your work?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Word of honour?’</p>

<p>‘Word of honour!’</p>

<p>‘I am coming—you may come and look
at me, if you like; but mind: don’t you try
to look down.’</p>

<p>I walked to the mouth of the Cave, and
there, a few yards above me, was the beautiful
head peeping over the summit, the eyes smiling
down into mine. Only the face was visible;
she must have been stretched full length on
the rock.</p>

<p>A few moments, and I was in soft delicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">(236)</span>
touch of her again, as we crept along the ledge;
and I kept touch, as we crossed the angle of
the slope on our way to the schoolhouse, for,
though help was no longer needed, Victoria
still let me guard her hand. And so we
walked through the twilight, without wanting
to speak a word.</p>

<p>That lecture was never delivered. When
I saw all their happy faces in the schoolroom,
I felt that I could not spoil their holiday. I
accordingly chose another subject, while the
Ancient was making his introductory speech,
and trusted to my star. The star was friendly.
The Ancient wasted a good deal of time;
and, when he sat down, I was ready for a
spirited improvisation on the Benefits of the
Printing Press, with which they were perfectly
content.</p>

<p>‘Light the torches, Reuben,’ said the old
man when the applause had subsided, ‘and
let the youngsters go bird-nesting on the
Ridge, for the wind-up. Victoria, and all the
girls that are good girls, will stay behind and
sing us a song. There is light enough on the
Green.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.<br>
<span class="title">MISUNDERSTANDING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">A quarrel with Victoria?—no, not a quarrel,
I want another word. Only ‘a something.’
What is it? I do not know.</p>

<p>Victoria has become ‘unaccountable’—we
will put it in that way. There is no knowing
what to be at with Victoria: the grievance
is there. And I have tried so hard to find
out.</p>

<p>That affair of the Peak was a lesson, or I
tried to make it one. ‘Leave Victoria alone,’
it seemed to say, ‘and keep your homage,
respectful and other, to yourself. Victoria
wants to tell you something, but does not
know how to begin. Cannot you save her
the trouble? You confuse her with your
homage, respectful and other, and she wants
you to leave her alone. Curly stops the
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">(238)</span></p>

<p>‘What matter that Curly is as vague as
something in Orion! He has taken her heart
with him into space. Leave her alone.</p>

<p>‘Do you want further proof of it? How
many more times must you see her prostrate
before his shrine in the thicket, as you saw
her yesterday, when you dogged her footsteps
like a spy? How many more times must you
hear her cry, “Come back, come back, and
help me!” between her passionate kisses of
the bits of fetich on the boughs?</p>

<p>‘And, if there were no Curly, how would
that avail? Victoria is not for you. Are you
to stay here for ever? You know you are
not. And how could you take Victoria
away?</p>

<p>‘Victoria is a savage; and who would
have her anything else? Will you put Pocahontas
in crêpe de Chine and surah, in lace,
embroideries, and gimp, and transplant her to
the London drawing-rooms, to make sport for
the London crowd? Are you looking forward
to this: “A lady whose tall figure is well
known in London society wore black silk,
opening over a front of white silk muslin,
draped from neck to feet, and confined at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">(239)</span>
waist with a pointed band of black velvet,
fastened by a diamond clasp”?</p>

<p>‘It will not do.</p>

<p>‘Friendship is impossible on your side:
when you are with her, you invariably play
the fool. Keep out of her way.’</p>

<p>So, I am on longer Victoria’s shadow. I
wander alone. I make up to the Ancient,
and borrow his fowling piece, to pay my
respects to the wild birds. The wild birds
do not mind. I trouble them a good deal less
than I trouble Victoria. It is an old fowling
piece; how did men contrive to kill anything
in the days when it was made, especially to
kill one another? The slaughter of Malplaquet
quite enhances one’s respect for the
race, and takes rank with Stonehenge and the
Pyramids among material marvels wrought by
simple means.</p>

<p>I have kept this up for some days, and I
am popping at a flock of gulls this morning,
with so slight a breach of the good understanding
between us that the flock increases,
by the effect of intelligent curiosity, as the
sport goes on, when Victoria stands between
me and the light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">(240)</span></p>

<p>It is here that Victoria begins to be unaccountable:
on the strength of this incident, I
made the charge.</p>

<p>For Victoria has come to look for me.
There is no need to guess it: she says so in
terms. Only mark what follows this admission,
and say if I am without a grievance.</p>

<p>‘Why have you come to look for me,
Victoria?’</p>

<p>‘I am so miserable.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘You make me miserable.’</p>

<p>‘What have I done, Princess?’</p>

<p>‘What have <em>I</em> done? You have hardly
spoken to me for three days.’</p>

<p>‘I thought you would like that best,
Victoria.’</p>

<p>‘Why should you think so? What would
this place be to me, if we were bad friends?’</p>

<p>‘I trouble you.’</p>

<p>‘Leave me to judge of that. There cannot
be any harm in seeing you, in talking to you.’</p>

<p>So, I leave the disgusted gulls; and we
ramble to the further side of the Island, to the
place where I landed in the dawn of history
to find the New World.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">(241)</span></p>

<p>We do not talk much at first. I am working
out the situation, with due aid from certain
phrases of convention that help to reconcile
poverty of thought to self-respect. These
little felicities of epigram on the inconsistency
of Woman never helped anybody to comprehension
of her; yet, if they were taken out of
its phrase books, the world would be acutely
sensible of the void. Few people are inconsistent,
but a good many people fail to understand.
I wish I were not so dull. I seem
to have found Victoria to about as much purpose
as a savage might find a watch.</p>

<p>So, for some precious moments, it is the
old footing again. We are as free as the other
animals about us, and perhaps still more exquisitely
happy. It might be rash, though,
to attempt to answer for any but ourselves.
Our myriads of birds and insects, and our
select assortment of beasts, seem to have a
good time—a life in the sun, and a quick
death in their prime of strength, with their
business hours mainly employed in dining, and
in exercise in the open air. Most of the
beasts belong to the Island family as much as
the men and women; and Victoria could give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">(242)</span>
them each a name. With her, they only play
at being wild; and the outlaw goats seek her
as regularly for their morning caress as their
friends who have made their peace with civilisation.</p>

<p>If she and I could be like this for ever!
But we cannot. We seem to be friends and
strangers, by turns; for the life of me, I know
not why. We move to and from each other
in some mysterious way. For, what happened
just now, happens again and again. I am
with her, as I could always wish to be, till
some subtle change in her manner makes me
think she wants me to keep away. I keep
away, and she seeks me out, with reproaches
for coldness and neglect. We reach perfection,
and then imperfection begins. Slowly,
slowly, as some change in the colour of a
plant, comes Victoria’s new mistrust of me, or
of herself. What is it? what can it be?
It is a movement of some strange law of her
emotions; but what is the law? The savage
has learned so much about his watch as to
feel the utter inadequacy of the reflection
that watches have curious ways. He cannot
examine, but he begins to guess. There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">(243)</span>
but one guess to make, the old one—it must
be the phantasm of the living Curly that
stands between us and the perfect light. We
know what came of that guess before. If I
step back to make way for him, Victoria will
follow, to know the reason why. A pest on
him for a phantom that plays us on and off:
it is neither my fault, nor Victoria’s; it is the
phantom that does not know its own mind!</p>

</div>


<p class="noindent">Let him be forgotten for the moment. There
is a new ship off the Point!</p>

<p>Not an English ship this time—a Yankee,
by her beautiful flag.</p>

<p>It is the old scene—the hurried assembling
of the people; the signals and answering
signals; the manning of the surf boat; the
meeting of the elders for consultation as to
ways and means of reception. But this meeting
is for serious work. The new ship is a
trader; and only a ship of war imports no
danger to these defenceless folk. There may
be a rough crew, not too well in hand, fierce
men, beyond punishment for excess, immediate
or remote. If they choose to go wrong,
the whole Island is at their mercy, not only in
goods and chattels, but in the honour of the
women, the lives of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">(245)</span></p>

<p>The troubled Ancient, I think, would like
to bury his treasure of maidens for awhile, if
only he might hope to dig them up again, safe
and sound, when the danger is past. He looks
about him with the furtive glance that seeks
a hiding-place, like some Jute progenitor on
the approach of a pirate horde. But he wisely
gives no public sign of alarm, and he sets out
in his whaler to board the new-comer, with a
cheerful face.</p>

<p>All depends upon the character of the
Captain, and we are re-assured upon that
point the moment he steps ashore. He gives
a ‘candy’ from his pocket to a child, and lifts
his hat to one of the girls in a way that is
unmistakeable as a sign of genuine respect.</p>

<p>He is unlike all other sea captains, past
and present, if not to come. He is a young,
blonde dandy, with his hair parted in the
middle, regular features, and a silken moustache.
These appearances would be altogether
difficult to harmonise with his functions, but
for the firm set of the lips, and the glance
of the clear blue eye. His handkerchief is
slightly scented—there cannot be a doubt of
it, and he is above the suspicion of a quid.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">(246)</span>
His speech sometimes betrays his origin, but
does not, in the least, betray his calling. He
‘shivers’ no ‘timbers’—but none of them
ever do that. He occasionally talks like a
book, and rather like a book read aloud in
class. This, however, is only when he has
time to think of himself, and to behave at his
best. At these moments, happily rare, his
construction is anything but idiomatic; it is
classically ornate. The Americanism appears
in his puritanical anxiety to give every word,
and every letter of every word, its full phonetic
value. He extends the principles of the
Declaration of Independence to his syllables,
and makes them all free and equal, without
a trace of accentuation that might render
one the tyrant of the rest. His orthoepic
constitution for the language, in short, is a
constitution without a king. Yet he has
the fear of Webster ever before his eyes,
and that authority is evidently his Supreme
Court.</p>

<p>We lodge him in our house, at my request.
This, I believe, anticipates a desire of the
Ancient, who, while awaiting fuller knowledge,
wants to have him under his eye. He shares<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">(247)</span>
my chamber, and is accommodated with a
spare bed therein. His crew, with one or two
exceptions, abide on the ship, but they have
shore leave, and, before they have it, so says
the Ancient, who brought him off, he makes
them a short speech, which is evidently
remembered throughout their entire stay. He
is a restless man. Almost as soon as he takes
up his quarters under our roof, he leaves them;
and, before sundown, he has walked all over
the Island; has inquired into its systems of
government, laws, agriculture, commerce, and
manufactures; has recognised the clock as a
gift from Chicago, the organ as a present from
Salem; and has suggested improvements in
nearly every process of industry, that would
double the yield. He has also asked to see
our newspaper; and, without waiting to learn
that we do not possess such a thing, has offered
us a bundle of journals of both hemispheres
which, he says, may supply ‘items’ of interest
for the compilation of the local sheet.</p>

<p>At first he was taciturn, or merely interrogatory;
and he showed extreme caution in his
communications to us. But, towards evening,
all this disappeared, and his fluency, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">(248)</span>
readiness to relate his own story left nothing
to be desired.</p>

<p>It was the typical American career of the
past, and so, for all his freshness and alertness,
I thought him an old-fashioned man. The new
generation of Americans are mostly men of
one career, as we are: this one was of half a
dozen. He had begun life as an office boy,
had been a real-estate agent, a lawyer, an
editor of a newspaper, and was now a skipper,
by what he considered a process of quite
orderly development. He had sailed from San
Francisco, and he was going to make the tour
of the world, by way of Suez and the Mediterranean,
Liverpool and New York. His
ship was his own property, and her cargo
was his pocket-money for the voyage. The
Ancient asked him how he learned the trade
of the sea, but he seemed unaware that there
was a trade to learn. He could hardly
remember a time when he did not know it, in
its elements. As a boy, he used to sail a
yacht about New York Bay; and he had
served a year in a whaler, before the mast.
At one time, he had thought of going into art.</p>

<p>How had he learned editing, then? That,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">(249)</span>
too, he hardly knew. All crafts, he assured
us, were governed by the same general
principle of common sense. Editing a newspaper
was but sailing a ship, under new conditions.
You put your mind to it, and you
rounded your back for the burden of your
inevitable mistakes. If he had a natural turn,
he thought, it was for scheming things, and
getting down to first principles. In the course
of his journalistic experiences, it had once
been his duty to turn out a weekly column of
jokes. He was not a joker by taste, nor by
choice, but he could invent jokes, of course,
if it had to be done. He studied out the principles
of the thing, and he found that they lay
in startling contrasts, and in startling similitudes.
With a little practice, he soon became
able to make a joke on anything—the inkstand
on his desk, the rent in the carpet, the
passing shower. He settled the points beforehand,
and then worked up to them, straight
and sharp. The failures came from ‘fooling
around’ the subject. He made two or three
jokes for us, as specimens. He did this with
a perfectly grave face, apologising for a certain
rustiness of habit due to his having been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">(250)</span>
for some time out of that line. They were
really very fair jokes; and, if we had not been
so fully forewarned of the expected result, I
think we might have laughed. They had to
be ‘popped’ on you, as he explained. The
Ancient promised to try them on Reuben, and
our new acquaintance warranted they would
make him gay. On the same general principle
of observation, he had invented a way of
simplifying a ship’s rig, saving 45 per cent. in
cordage and blocks; and he promised to show
us a model of it, made on the voyage.</p>

<p>By nightfall, we felt that he had exhausted
us and our little island, and that he would
fain be off. This, however, was impossible
for the moment: the ship wanted more fresh
provisions, and she was, besides, under slight
repairs. It fretted him sorely, for he could
not be still. Never did I see such feverish
activity, such a passion for doing something.
His meals were a mockery of Divine Providence;
but, as he did not choke, he must
have been reserved for special uses. In ten
minutes he had disposed of fish, flesh, and
his hunk of pie. Only a Rabelais could conceive
the war of elements within. There was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">(251)</span>
no rest in him, nor near him; he was busy all
over the surface of life, with no sense of the
true uses of any one thing. It was a sheer
fury of industrial action, like the old Berserker
fury of war. He worked for the love of
it, as the children of Starkader fought; and
he seemed to have no more profit of his
labour than they of their shedding of blood.
It seemed quite a triumph to get him to bed.</p>

<p>He slept in my room, as I have said, or he
was to sleep. But he could not lay him down
till he had analysed the composition of the
mattress, and thrown out suggestions for a
new kind of stuffing, to be made of something
that grew wild at the foot of the Peak. In
the midst of his discourse on this point, he
fell asleep, as suddenly as though he had
turned himself off at the main. I, too, dropped
off in a few minutes, and I slept soundly for
a few <span class="cor" title="Source: hours,until" id="cor251">hours, until</span> I was awakened, long before
dawn, by the gleam of a candle in my
eyes.</p>

<p>He, of course, had lit the candle; and he
was sitting upright in bed, and peering intently,
through an eyeglass, at something which he
held betwixt his finger and thumb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">(252)</span></p>

<p>‘See here,’ he said, without any apology
for waking me; ‘if that don’t beat all!’</p>

<p>‘What is it?’ I asked in some alarm.</p>

<p>‘Just the strongest moth you ever saw in
your life—pulls like a little cart-horse. I
was lighting-up for a bit of quiet thinking,
and in he buzzed.’</p>

<p>‘Let him go again.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, he can go: I shan’t want him yet,’
and he flung the insect off. ‘Are there many
of his sort here, I wonder? We must ask
old Forelock,’ so he called our host.</p>

<p>‘What if there are?’</p>

<p>‘See here,’ he said, propping himself up
with his pillow, and, to my dismay, preparing
for a long talk. ‘See here: I’ll tell
you something; that insect is undeveloped
Power.’</p>

<p>‘Well, what of that?’</p>

<p>‘Can’t you see?’ he asked in a tone expressive
of his certainty that I could not.</p>

<p>I gave him the desired negative, and he
went on.</p>

<p>‘That insect means half the motive power
in Nature clean thrown away.’</p>

<p>‘I do not follow you, as yet.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">(253)</span></p>

<p>‘I dare say, but you will come to it. How
about all the beasts of the field and the rest
of them being created for the service of
man?’</p>

<p>‘How about it!’ I was still only half
awake.</p>

<p>‘Well, they skulk their work, that’s all.
Half of them do nothing for their keep; do
you begin to follow me now?’</p>

<p>‘How should they?’</p>

<p>‘Set them to work; that’s the idea.’</p>

<p>I was wide awake now. It seemed like
a disclosure of some new invention in crime;
and, so far, it was appropriate to the midnight
hour, the darkness, and the deadly quiet
of the scene.</p>

<p>‘You surely never mean to say that you
want to put the song birds into factories?’</p>

<p>‘That is just what I do mean. It is only
a fad of mine at present, but I shall work it
out to something by-and-by. Did you ever
see the performing fleas?’</p>

<p>‘No; it is the only thing I have not seen.’</p>

<p>‘Well, sir, I have, and, from that moment,
I was a changed man. It is a mere toy with
the showmen; to a man that can put two and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">(254)</span>
two together, it is what the fall of the apple
was to Newton. The first time I saw it, I did
not sleep for three nights. I went into a dime
show in Broadway, and there were these
things, along with a Circassian lady, and, I
believe, a calculating boy. I began with the
fleas, and I never gave another thought to the
rest. There were a dozen of them, of various
sizes and nationalities—English fleas, Russian
fleas, American, and so on; and there was a
good deal of patter, that meant nothing, as to
what each nationality could do, all winding up,
of course, in honour of the Stars and Stripes.
The Russian flea was big, but lazy; the
English flea tough, but obstinate; the American
flea all sprightliness, audacity, energy,
and good sense. I soon stopped that, by
making believe I was a Scotchman, when he
produced a creature from its bed of wadding
in a pill-box, and said it came from Mull,
and was the smartest thing in his stables. I
gave him a dollar, and asked him not to play
the fool, and he fell to business at once. I
wanted to get at the principle of the thing,
you understand. The creatures were harnessed
with a woman’s hair—a man’s would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">(255)</span>
have been too coarse—tied round that dip in
their bodies that makes a natural waist.
Then, when you had them fast in this way by
one end of the hair, you put the other end to
whatever you wanted to set going—Queen
Victoria’s coach, in cardboard, or the miller’s
cart. The flea naturally tried to get away,
and that was your motive power. When you
wanted him to turn the treadmill, you put
him up against the wheel, just like his betters
and, the faster he tried to run away, the
faster the thing went round. That was
always the principle of it; utilise the movement
of flight—a new escapement beyond anything
in the watchmaker’s art. Well, sir, this
showman saw nothing beyond his fleas, but, at
a glance, I saw ahead of them to all animal
life. Make the animals earn their living, I
said to myself; work up your reflex action
for the benefit of man. It would solve the
labour problem: no more strikes! When
once I had got my thoughts in that groove, I
seemed to see nothing but loafing idleness in
all Nature. Take even the working animals;
what do many of them do for Man? There’s
nothing serious in beaver dams, for instance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">(256)</span>
from that point of view. They are generally
a mere obstruction, for want of an intelligent
foreman of the works. And as for the ants,
though I admit they are too small to count in
business, why flatter them up? I say nothing
of their useless fighting; but did an ant ever
make anything to eat, or anything to wear?
There, sir, when I got that idea into my head,
I couldn’t read the poets, for sheer disgust at
the way in which they wrote about these
creatures, and missed the real point. It was
the same when I went to a menagerie, and I
always went when I could. It made me real
sad. Think of the waste of power in a cage
of apes! Nothing to be done with them but
nut-cracking, and swinging on the horizontal
bar—never tell me!’</p>

<p>He had now settled himself for a long
night’s talk, and, all things considered, I was
not loath to find him a listener. There might
be still more in it, I thought, than even he
perceived; and, as he had looked beyond the
showman, others, who were not without a
lingering tenderness for a beauty of life fast
perishing of the malady of use, might look
beyond him. Besides, now that one was fairly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">(257)</span>
awake, it was so sweet to feel alive again.
For, beyond the gleam of his candle, I caught
a glimpse of the starry sky, and his monotone
was sometimes tempered to the ear by
the note of a night bird.</p>

<p>The bird seemed to put him in a rage.
‘Just so! Just so!’ he said with severity,
apostrophising the unseen musician through
the open casement. ‘How should you know
better, when those who ought to know have
been encouraging you all their lives? Did
you ever read a book called “The Birds of
the Poets,” my friend? It is just <span class="cor" title="Source: heartbreaking" id="cor257">heart-breaking</span>,
if you take it from the point of view of
an employer of labour. All this singing—why
do they do it? Just because there’s
nobody to set them to work. Who does
most whistling? The loafer at the street
corner. It’s pent up energy, sir, that must
find a vent. That’s why there’s so much fuss
about feathered love-making: they’ve got to
kill time. Develop industry, and you’ll soon
have less billing and cooing. Look at Spain
and Italy—why it was nothing but that sort
of thing till they went into manufactures.
There ain’t much guitar playing in Catalonia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">(258)</span>
now; and you’d better not go to Bilbao, if
you’ve a taste for the castanets. Men have
got to keep themselves employed; and, if
they are not making cottons, or smelting iron,
they’ll be fighting duels, or running off with
one another’s wives. The animal kingdom is
full of wasted power, that’s my point. You
can’t use all of it: we haven’t got to that
pitch of intelligence; but you can begin to
try. Did you ever notice a cloud hanging
low over the water, not a yard away, and
stretching, perhaps, for miles and miles?
What do you think it is? Young shrimps
bounding up and down, just to show they’re
glad—millions, billions, trillions of ’em.
There’s power for you, if you could work it
up. I don’t say you could, in this case; I
don’t want to be fanciful. I only say what a
fine thing, if you could: let us talk like
practical men. See how the dog has sneaked
out of industry. One time he used to earn
his own dinner by roasting his master’s; but
that’s all over now. I don’t say he costs less
than the roasting-jack, but I’m talking of the
principle of the thing. What is he now? A
machine for licking the hand of his owner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">(259)</span>
and for barking when visitors pull the bell.
It ain’t as though he washed your hand—you’ve
got to wash it after him, instead—and
if the help is too deaf to hear the bell, she
will be too deaf to hear the dog. The dog is
a humbug, and his show of affection is only a
way of fooling us out of a free lunch. What
does it amount to—all this running to and fro
after nothing, and all this jumping about?
Sheer waste of power. The Dutchmen and
the Esquimaux are the only wise people; they
turn it to account. Put him in harness, and
he’ll soon leave off pawing your pants. As
for cats, I am ashamed of them, and I am
more ashamed of the human beings that
encourage them in their profitless ways. In
most houses, they don’t even catch the mice:
it’s all done with traps. A pet animal of any
kind is an economic monstrosity. Do you
know how I interpret the singing of birds in
their cages? They are sniggering at man to
think they have done him out of their board.
There’s a use for everything; why, even
tortoises, if you know how to manage them,
will tell you when it’s going to rain. Sir, I
want to make idleness a caution to the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">(260)</span>
animal creation—even a caution to snakes.
The bloodhound—send him back into the
Police service, and give him a blue overcoat
for uniform, if you like. There’s power everywhere;
why you’ve a perfect sledge hammer
in every alligator’s tail! How about the weight
of the hippopotamus for crushing cane? I’d
just turn your Zoological Gardens into a factory,
by thunder I would! and make every
blessed animal do something for his living.
No song, no supper. The squirrels would do
for thread winders; the giraffes, for reaching
things off shelves. You’d lose by it at starting,
just as you do by prison labour, but you’d
soon find out how to make it pay.’</p>

<p>He seemed to be growing drowsy, but I
was wakeful enough, and I wanted him to go
on. My curiosity seemed to gratify him, and
he roused himself for a further effort.</p>

<p>‘You want to begin somewhere, on a small
scale—in some place where there’s nobody to
laugh. It’s like any other experiment; you’ll
have to play with it at first, and keep your
own counsel. You want a little place up in a
corner; this place would do. Why not this
place, eh?’ he said, sitting bolt upright, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">(261)</span>
fixing me with the inventor’s eye. ‘You are
quiet; you are out of the world; you ain’t of
much account in creation—you know my
meaning—and you’ve no character to lose.
Just think of it; one fine day you might send
your little specimen of animal manufactures
to a European Exhibition, and then you’d be
a second hub of the universe. What do you
do with your goats, for instance? Why not
put ’em into harness? I mean real business,
not baby play. How about a goat tramway
from old Forelock’s house there, all along the
Ridge, to the foot of the Point? fare, a potato,
if you must carry your small change about in
that way. You are just teeming with life, sir,
and life is power. Your sea birds—it’s a sad
sight! I know something could be done with
’em. Train up a happy family, new style—a
happy factory, the whole lot, cat, and dog,
and mouse, and guinea-pig, and barn-door
fowl, all at work, instead of sitting on the
mope, and all turning out something that
would sell by the yard. Then lecture on the
utilisation of reflex action all through the
States. It would make your fortune as a show,
and when that was played out, you could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">(262)</span>
easily get up a company to run it as a business
concern. You’ve no monkeys, but, lord, you
are rich in sea birds! I can’t bring in the
birds yet,’ he murmured, as another plaintive
note of a night watcher sounded from the outside.
‘I can’t bring in the birds.’</p>

<p>In another instant, he had turned himself
off at the main a second time, and was fast
asleep.</p>

<p class="noindent">There was no sleep for me. This seemed the
final stroke of treason against the happiness
of sentient life. I had done my best to spoil
humanity’s share of it, till Victoria entered her
<i lang="la">caveat</i> against the crime; and here was this
sleeping figure, as my logical sequel, with all
animate Nature for his mark.</p>

<p>It was a distressing thought, and I looked
round for something to drive it away. The
Captain’s bundle of newspapers lay on a chair,
and I took them up to read myself to sleep.</p>

<p>I might as well have taken coffee as
an opiate. As I turned these fatal leaves,
life in all its littleness seemed to beat in upon
me, with a suffocating rush, from every
quarter of the globe. I was in the fever-struck
crowd once more, after my spiritual
quarantine of months. It was as a coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">(264)</span>
back to consciousness after chloroform: my
brain throbbed, every pulsation was pain.
I darted from column to column, from page
to page. I had lost the art of selection: one
thing was as another thing, and each impression
was a shock. Once again, I realised
Europe and America, Asia and Africa, but
only as masses in a whirl. The Ball itself,
with all its continents, seemed to have suddenly
whizzed my way, as I lay dreaming on a
cloud in space. Every particle was in movement,
as well as the mass; it was a huge
rolling cheese, putrid with unwholesome being—a
low-bred world, not a world at all, a mere
glorified back-court, with all its cheatings,
thefts, lies, cruelties, small cares, and small
ambitions, multiplied into themselves, and into
one another, to make a whole. The finer
things alone seemed without an entry, as
though, in a business reckoning, such trifles
could not count.</p>

<p>I did not know how to read it. Picking
and choosing was impossible; I took it as it
came. ‘Brigandage in the public Thoroughfares;’
‘Foreign Paupers blocking the City

‘Parliament—two Members suspended;’ ‘Afghanistan—Five
hundred killed;’ ‘Moonlighting
in Ireland; a Policeman’s Head beaten
to Pulp;’ ‘Evictions—Death of an Old
Woman on the Roadside;’ ‘A Hundred
People Burned to Death in a Theatre;’
‘Brutal Treatment of a Boy.’ This was from
the English budget. The American was more
appalling in the cool devilry of its mocking
headlines, as though all the woe and all the
folly of the world were but one stupendous
joke—‘Green Immigrants sold like Cattle;’
‘Awful Railway Accident; the Line stripped
bare by Speculators, and no Money to Pay for
Repairs;’ ‘Mr. Chown’s Dyspepsia; In the Acquisition
of Millions, his Digestion had to go;’

<p>And then, suddenly, in one of our own
papers, my own name.</p>

<p class="p2">‘Henry is altogether inaccurate as to the
disappearance of poor Lord ——. He has been
missing, or, at any rate, away from home,
for nearly a year, instead of “for the better
part of two months.” The family at ——
Court have tried to keep the matter out of the
newspapers, and that, no doubt, is why Henry
has not heard of it till now. Others, who
were better informed, kept silent, because
they did not wish to cause unnecessary
alarm.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>‘It is certainly true that the shock has
been too much for the poor Dowager-Countess,
and that her condition causes the gravest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">(267)</span>
uneasiness. Lord —— was her favourite son.
It is not true that he has been heard from
only once since he left England. At the outset,
he wrote from Paris, as well as from
Genoa.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>‘The Genoa letter was somewhat enigmatical:—“Running
away for a ramble; news
when I come back.” This naturally excited
the Dowager’s apprehensions. The police
were consulted, somewhat too soon, and they
discovered that he had been seen at Geneva in
rather questionable company. The Dowager
immediately jumped to the conclusion that he
had fallen into a Nihilist snare. From that
moment, she refused to believe that he was
alive, and, though a subsequent letter bearing
his signature was shown to her, she declined
to accept the evidence of his handwriting.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>‘Henry is doubly wrong in saying that
Lord —— was never heard of after the Genoa
letter. A few weeks ago, direct news of him
was received in a rather extraordinary way.
During her late cruise in the South Seas,
H.M.S. “Rollo” touched at one of the Islands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">(268)</span>
(I forget which), and there, in the best of health
and spirits, she found the missing man. He
had fallen under the spell of a native beauty,
and, I believe, was about to get himself
tattooed, as a preliminary to adoption by the
tribe. He sent affectionate messages to his
family, but he could not be prevailed upon to
make any promise of an immediate return.’</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>‘The messages have been communicated
to the Dowager, but she persists in regarding
them with incredulity. She is persuaded that
Lord —— fell a victim to foul play at Genoa,
or Geneva, and that all these communications
have been forged in his name. Her
delusions constitute the only serious feature
of the case. These are the facts, if Henry
will condescend to accept them as such for
the benefit of his readers; and I may further
inform him that —— Court has been shut
up.’</p>

<span class="title">ANOTHER PARTING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">I dropped the paper, and lay staring at the
wall, with aching eyeballs, till long past dawn.
What my thoughts were, need not be told.
They were hardly thoughts; they were only
pangs of remorse.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, I rose, dressed in all haste,
saved my paper from the leafy litter of the
night, and went out to find the girl.</p>

<p>I met her, almost on the threshold, fresh
from her morning dip in the sea; and, without
greeting, put the paper in her hand—‘Victoria,
what must I do?’</p>

<p>I watched her face as she read, and saw all
its glow of youth and health die suddenly to
an ashen cast. There was something so awful
in the change that, without another word, I
walked away.</p>

<p>When I returned to the house, the Ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">(270)</span>
and the Skipper were alone, with the remains
of their breakfast before them. Victoria, to
all appearance, had served the meal as conscientiously
as though nothing had happened.
The old man pressed me to eat, and I broke
bread.</p>

<p>‘No one seems to have any appetite
this morning but you and me, Captain,’ he
said. ‘I wonder what’s the matter with my
girl?’</p>

<p>There was dead silence. I would not
answer, and the Captain could not. He
seemed to have an instinctive aversion to
situations of that sort, and he began to resume
the conversation which my entrance had
interrupted.</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir, off to-morrow morning; repairs
or no repairs. Time’s up. I’ve betted a hat
on this voyage. It’s a go-as-you-please match
against time, for the circumnavigation of the
globe. Don’t try to keep me; I shall lose my
hat!’</p>

<p>Victoria entered. If the red had not
come back to her cheek, the sickening white
had left. She seemed quite calm.</p>

<p>‘Our guest is going away to-morrow, girl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">(271)</span>
said the old man. ‘Tell him how we hate to
say good-bye.’</p>

<p>‘Both our guests are going away, my
father,’ was Victoria’s reply.</p>

<p>Her stern serenity seemed to preclude
debate. I could only look at her. The old
man, speechless, too, for the moment, glanced
from one to the other of us. Even the Captain
seemed roused to a perception of something
out of the common.</p>

<p>‘Both going away,’ repeated the Ancient,
after a pause. ‘Surely you, sir——’</p>

<p>‘My father,’ said Victoria gently, ‘I know
what I am saying; and our friend knows it
too. He must go. Let us try to thank God
that we have kept him so long.’</p>

<p>‘What’s amiss?’ inquired the old man.
‘What have we done? I’ve always wanted
him to think that he is master here.’</p>

<p>‘Dearest friend!’ I said, taking his honest
hand—I could say no more.</p>

<p>‘This is it, my father,’ said the girl, coming
to where we sat, and kissing the old man.
‘Our friend’s life is not our life. He has his
own people, and his people call him. They
have been calling to him ever since he came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">(272)</span>
us, and last night their voice reached him half
way round the world. The time has come for
another parting, that is all. Sooner or later,
all things end that way with us. Our little
Island is the house of parting, and God has
made us to live alone.’</p>

<p>‘If I only knew what we had done amiss!’
repeated the foolish old man.</p>

<p>‘Oh, father, won’t you try to understand?’
she said, kissing him tenderly, again. ‘See
what is written here,’ and she gave him the
paper. ‘But you cannot know all it means.
I will tell you, if only our friends will leave
us together for a little while.’</p>

<p>We went out. The Captain, feeling the
situation beyond him, had fallen into a watchful
silence. I satisfied his natural curiosity in
a few words, as soon as we were outside. I
was glad of that relief of speech, such as it
was. There was no relief possible, in utterance,
for my deeper thoughts. I wanted
something to rouse me from what seemed a
creeping torpor of death.</p>

<p>It came, as we made our way through the
settlement. The child that had been the
herald of my coming was now the herald of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">(273)</span>
my going. She was Victoria’s favourite,
and she had perhaps received a hint when
the girl’s resolution was formed. At any
rate, the sprite was running from house to
house, as briskly as on the day of that first
message:—‘Mother, mother! here’s a lord.’
It was that scene again with a difference—the
people trooping out of their cottages, the
women crying, the men pressing forward to
wring my hand, and all asking questions at
once in the third person, though they seemed
to be addressed to me; ‘Why is he going?
What has happened? How did he get the
message? Oh, his poor mother! Will she
ever forgive us? Thirteen thousand miles
away! Make him promise to come back.
What will Victoria do?’ As they talked,
others could be seen running towards us from
the distant fields, leaving their work as they
got wind of the dire report. ‘Business was
suspended’ for the day.</p>

<p>Then the Ancient left his house, and joined
the group. He held up his hand, and they
gathered about him in full plebiscitary meeting
of the settlement. ‘Friends,’ he said,
‘we are going to lose a brother. I hoped to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">(274)</span>
keep him for ever, but Victoria says he must
go. I hoped he would forget the way back,
and the home he left behind; but something
has come to remind him of it. Even now I
do not well know what it is, but something
has come. The women, I think, will understand
it better than we do. I hoped he would
stay with us, and be our guide and teacher,
and let me take my rest. We want a helper
to show us how they do things out in the
great world. Some say we are happier without
it—who can tell? We are as children
that have never known a mother’s knee. He
could have shown us the way. I must not
ask him to stay: Victoria says he ought to go,
and Victoria knows’ (voices, ‘Yes, Victoria
knows’). ‘If I might ask him, I would say,
“Take all you want here—all it is in our
power to give—my place, my bit of land——”’</p>

<p>‘Give him the long field under the Ridge!’
cried the voices again; ‘Build a house for
him! Make him magistrate next year! Have
two magistrates!’</p>

<p>All turned towards me. I shook my
head. The children clustered about me, crying,
and soon, with their treble, was mingled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">(275)</span>
a deeper note of woe. How shall words paint
the misery of that scene? As I had felt
before, so I felt now—a rage of pity for the
sorrow that seems to be our lot in life.</p>

<p>A word or act of power and control was
wanting; and it came. Victoria, tearless, and
with the set look on her face that I had
caught for an instant on the day she saved
my life at the Cave, stepped into our midst,
and drew the old man aside. After that, not
a word was spoken, and the assembly seemed
to melt away.</p>

<p>Victoria had become the leader of the settlement;
no one seemed to question her commands.
They were not commands so much
as imperious wishes which all divined. It
was understood that the Captain was to give
me passage to Europe; he was never asked to
do it. Still less, was I asked if I would take
the passage. Victoria pushed forward my
departure with an energy, controlling and
controlled, worthy of a crisis of battle. She
stood on the beach while the whale boat
laboured to and fro betwixt ship and shore to
complete our exchange of stores with the
American. The presents of the Islanders to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">(276)</span>
me made the better part of an entire load.
I had brought nothing to the Island but the
clothes in which I stood upright, and a roll of
paper money which the Ancient had always
refused to diminish by the substance of a
single note. The money had not been useless,
for all that. It had enabled me to make
some purchases, to repair my outfit, on the
coming of the Queen’s ship, and now it procured
from the crew of the trader a few
presents for my generous hosts.</p>

<p>The excitement of these preparations
helped to suspend the anguish of parting.
But, at nightfall, this returned with cruel
force, when the people gathered on the moonlit
green, to sing me their simple songs of farewell.
It was the whole settlement, save one:
Victoria was not to be found. They came with
cheerful faces: the sorrow of the morning,
I knew, would be renewed in due season, but
their natures lived ever in the moment as it
passed. The children prattled and played;
and, in the murmur of talk among their elders,
there was no note of woe. Under the shining
sun, it might have been a scene of joy; and,
if the moonlight touched it into sadness, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">(277)</span>
was but a spiritual association of ideas. They
sang all that they thought would please me,
all that I had ever liked—the joyous songs,
of course, in preference. All were sad songs to
me. At last, with slow and measured cadence,
their perfect voices rising in the perfect night,
they began the one I had always loved most.
It was a song of parting and of death, with
the burden, ‘When I am gone—when I am
gone.’</p>

<p>Before the second stanza was over, I had
stolen from my place in the shadow, with
such a passion of sorrow stirring to the very
depths of my being, as I had never known
in all my life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.<br>
<span class="title">AN EXPLANATION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent">I walked away in unutterable despondency,
relieved only by one purpose, one hope—to
find Victoria. I had not far to go to seek
her: her statuesque form was outlined against
the clear sky above the Peak.</p>

<p>She turned to greet me with a grave smile.</p>

<p>‘You came away before it was over; I
was wiser than you, I came away before it
began. I suppose it is because we are wild
people that we make such a ceremony of
saying “Good-bye.” Before they taught us to
be Christians, you know, we used to make
just the same fuss about death.’</p>

<p>‘Is it good-bye, Victoria? I hardly know
what it is. It looks like dismissal, without a
word of leave-taking. You seem to have sent
me away.’</p>

<p>‘I <em>have</em> sent you away,’ she said, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">(279)</span>
voice trembling a little, and then instantly
recovering its tone. ‘Yes, I want always to
be able to feel that I told you, when the time
had come, to go.’</p>

<p>A pang shot through my heart that was
not regret, but a sort of jealous rage.</p>

<p>‘You are a great observer of times and
seasons, Victoria. Perhaps, even now, I have
lingered too long.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps,’ she said, with the note deeper,
richer than before, but no less firm. Then
she added, as though to make her meaning
more clear:</p>

<p>‘If there were all the reasons in the world
for keeping you, dearest friend, you must still
go, to save your mother’s life. You feel the
force of that reason as much as I do. Why
seek for more?’</p>

<p>‘That reason, from myself to myself,
Victoria, may be enough. It is not enough
from you to me.’</p>

<p>‘From me to you then,’ she said; ‘will this
do? All things leave us, as we stand here in
this Isle; all things pass us by. Whatever
comes to us, as surely goes. Why should we
hope to keep it, when that must be the end?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">(280)</span>
God has marked us out for solitude: let us
bow to God’s will. Nothing could keep you
here: it is written. Nothing has kept others.’</p>

<p>The pang that had almost ceased darted
through me again with its full force, at these
last words. ‘Cold, cruel heart!’ I said in a
fury of pain, ‘you have never cared to keep
me. Why had you not pity enough to let me
die, when the waves tossed me here?’</p>

<p>She gave me one glance, of which I could
not catch the full expression in the uncertain
light, straightened herself, folded her hands behind
her, and turned her face towards the sea.</p>

<p>The wrathful agony of my feelings endured
even under this rebuke, much as I felt I deserved
it. I was distinctly aware that I was
playing a pitiful part before her, and distinctly
unable to help playing it. The torment of
losing her, of being nothing to her, overpowered
every finer feeling: and the more I
felt the degradation of my violence, the more
desperate the violence seemed to become. I
felt only the goading of the pain of loss, and,
forgetting all my fine resolves to treat her
with the disdain with which I thought she
was treating me, I caught her in my arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">(281)</span>
and covered her lips, her eyes, her brow, with
passionate kisses, till she sank for support
upon a jutting stone. It was no timid first
kiss of pastoral flirtation, but twenty, following
as quick on one another as a rain of angry
blows. There was a sort of anger in them,
as well as love. I seemed to feel that I had
been made the sport of her innocence. What
had I not lost by trying to outdo her in
tenderness, in generosity, and reserve? So I
interpret my feelings now: at the moment,
nothing could have been more devoid of conscious
motive than the madness of this act.
The brute that is in each of us, and that is
only half held in check by laws, observances,
and uses, seemed suddenly to have slipped his
chain.</p>

<p>Yet, if the act was a surprise to me, in
itself, it was a greater surprise in its effect
upon Victoria. The girl seemed to sink down,
from sheer want of the power of resistance.
The lips parted, without word or sound, but
the eyes met the fierce gaze of mine with infinite
tenderness; and, when she did speak,
this was what I heard:</p>

<p>‘Oh, I love you, I love you—better than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">(282)</span>
my own life: and I will never have you love
me: and to-morrow you shall go away from
me for ever.’</p>

<p>The thing had been said, and there was no
unsaying it. In vain, Victoria, resuming her
self-control almost as quickly as she had lost
it, disengaged herself from my arms, which
had sought her beautiful shape.</p>

<p>She sat silent, in what I could not but feel
was a silence of shame. For the moment, I
was silent too. We were both, in a manner,
stunned by the shock of that avowal. Victoria
had said what she meant never to say: I had
heard what I never hoped to hear. If I had
expectation of anything—though, indeed, I
think I had none—it was rather of anger and
fierce repulse.</p>

<p>I was the first to recover speech, if not
self-possession. I took her hand: thank Heaven
I had enough sense and feeling left not to
claim her lips on the strength of what had
just passed. I tried to tell her something of
what I had wanted to tell her all this weary
time—how my love for her had come, first,
through the divine suggestion of her shape,
and voice, and ways, and how her soul had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">(283)</span>
completed what they had begun, and turned
enchantment into one of the laws of being.</p>

<p>She listened, and soon, as I could see,
no longer with shame. The hand I held returned
the pressure of my own, and I felt the
thrilling touch of the other on my brow and
hair.</p>

<p>She spoke at last. ‘Listen, dear friend:
now all must be said. It is too late to blame
you for what has happened, or even to blame
myself for letting it happen. It was to be.
No human soul could be angry that knew
how I tried, not even——’</p>

<p>I would not let her utter the name. ‘Never
speak of him. What can he be to you? What
fate does he deserve?’ but she laid her finger
on my lips.</p>

<p>‘I know; my heart is yours, but only he
shall release my hand.’</p>

<p>‘Victoria!’</p>

<p>‘Oh! listen, listen, and be still! I know all
that must be said, and all that must be
done.</p>

<p>‘When you first came, my heart was his,
or I thought it was. I thought it had gone
out with him into the world—your world, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">(284)</span>
the next one, they are both just as far away
from us. I don’t know what I felt about you,
except that I felt what was good and true and
right. Was it wrong to like you? How can
anyone help liking you that knows you? You
spoke to me as no one had spoken to me
before. You seemed to know all things. I
only wanted to listen to you, and still be true
to him. All my hope of myself was in being
true. Our people do not always know what
that sort of truth is. There are the two
strains in our blood; we are English, and
something else. It has shocked me, from my
girlhood up, to see how we sometimes forget.
We feel so quickly; and all our feeling is in
each terrible moment as it flies. I set myself
above our people; I shuddered to think I
should ever be like that. My love was part
of my respect for myself. Half our women
have had their love tokens taken away in
Queen’s ships, and have still lived on to be
wives and mothers in the Isle. I could not,
I would not be like that.</p>

<p>‘I did not blame then; I pitied! It is all
so splendid when the Queen’s ships come.
The young men in them seem to have dropped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">(285)</span>
from the sky. It is like the book of the
Heathen mythology, with the gods coming
down.</p>

<p>‘When I saw you, I did not know it was to
be like that. I felt sure of myself, and, if I
had doubted, still I should have felt sure of
you. Then slowly, slowly, slowly, came the
dreadful change, though, if you had not
spoken that day, I might never have known
that it had come. When I did know, still it
did not seem to be too late. My pride was
strong: I did not know the strength of my
weakness. I went there every day—to the
thicket, and prayed to have him sent back
to me. I tried to shut you quite out from
my heart, but still to keep you in my soul.
You were so good; you made me think I had
done it. You tried to make me think so; I
knew you tried; and your very goodness only
made it worse and worse.</p>

<p>‘Then, I felt I was no longer sure of myself.
I tried to keep away from you; but, to have
you near me, and not to see you, not to speak
to you, made all the world seem dead and cold.
So, I always came back to find you again, of
my own accord, wanting to keep all my happiness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">(286)</span>
when I ought to have chosen which part
of it I should give up.’</p>

<p>‘Victoria, if only I had known; if only I
had understood!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, how dreadful, if you thought me light-minded,
playing you off and on. All that I
wanted was to like you as much as I dared,
without having you like me more than you
ought. I should have done, what I see now I
must do—send you away, for both our sakes.
If I did not see it at once, pity, dear friend,
pity, and forgive!</p>

<p>‘Then, I prayed again for help; and see
how the help has come! We might both of us
have been too weak for that sacrifice, but now
it is laid upon us without our wills. You
must go.’</p>

<p>‘I will come back, come to claim you, my
Victoria, to bring you your word of release,
to take you, whether you will or no.’</p>

<p>‘You will never come back,’ she said in a
tone that seemed to be beyond both hope and
despair, and she held my face up to the light
and looked down into it with tender yet tearless
eyes. ‘You ought not to come back:
your place is in the great world—poor little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">(287)</span>
great world! Try to think there is something
nobler than love for one—pity for all. Go;
and live for those poor people you have
talked about to me.’</p>

<p>‘I am not equal to it: I could only die
for them, at best.’</p>

<p>‘Still—I know what I am saying—others
must claim you: your station——’</p>

<p>‘O Victoria, is your opinion of me so
low? Do you send me back to resume the
“English gentleman”; and to hide my shame
in being nothing in the smug proprieties of
that poor creature’s lot?’</p>

<p>‘I do not know, dear friend, but this I
feel—we must lose you for ever: no one
returns here.’</p>

<p>‘Then let me never go away,’ I cried, rising,
and clasping her again to my heart. ‘Let me
love you, and be with you for ever, and forget
all the world beside.’</p>

<p>Once more I saw a beginning of that
exquisite languor which had almost made her
mine. The lips of the beautiful creature
parted, but only in sighs; the eyes closed. Once
more, too, my own lips approached them,
when the girl roused herself, by some mysterious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">(288)</span>
exertion of will, tore herself from
my embrace, and ran to the very edge of the
cliff.</p>

<p>‘Deep into the deep sea, beloved one,
for ever beloved of my heart, if you come one
step more! Go now, go from me, and leave
me to say my prayers. I love you; take that
last word from Victoria; you will never hear
her voice again.’</p>

<p>‘She shall hear mine. After such a last
word, my Victoria, there must be more. If
you could have told me I was nothing to you,
I would have gone for ever; now, Death alone
shall part you and me. Go, I must, for a
season, but your blessed promise, for promise
it is, makes it almost easy to say farewell.
Be sure of this, I will come back to claim you,
from the other side of the world. I will
leave you now, since my presence troubles
you; I will even set sail without trying to
speak to you again. But, before I go, you
<em>shall</em> give me a sign or a token—a token
of submission, my Victoria, I claim no
less, a sign that you have conquered your
foolish superstition of fidelity, and your cruel
pride.’</p>

<p class="noindent">I had no room-fellow that night. The Captain
had gone on board, to sleep, leaving word
that he would fire his signal-gun very early
in the morning. I should have been ready
for it, if it had come at dawn.</p>

<p>The day was but just breaking, when I
heard someone stirring in the next room. I
ran in, with I know not what wild hope, but
only to find the old man.</p>

<p>He was standing near the recess that
formed her bed-chamber, with the sliding
panel in his hand, and staring helplessly at the
empty bed. It had not been used that night.</p>

<p>The glance he turned on me was enough;
I did not wait for his words, but rushed out
of the house.</p>

<p>That horror, thank God, was a false
alarm. The child who was her favourite was
running towards our cottage with a message<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">(290)</span>
that should have been delivered the night
before. She had passed the night under a
neighbour’s roof.</p>

<p>As I hurried back with the news to the
old man, I heard the signal gun.</p>

<p>A week has passed, yet I cannot clearly
recall what followed. I am dimly aware of
a last look at the cottage and the settlement,
of a crowd of weeping villagers, of the grasp
of the Ancient’s hand. There is an almost
absolute void of perception between the boat
at the landing-stage, and the ship, with her
solitary passenger, flying at full speed from
the shore. Active consciousness seems to
have been suspended between these two decisive
facts. Memory is resumed, with one
ineffaceable impression that it must hold for
life—Victoria stretching her arms towards
the ship, from the summit of the Peak. As
she stood there, with her background of
fleecy cloud, she seemed rather of heaven
than of earth, and her gesture was a promise
of the skies. Then, I knew that it was well
with me; and I turned my face from the
Island with a joyful heart.</p>
